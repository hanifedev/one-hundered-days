# Day 14 Analysis: Final Review & Delivery

## Objective
Finalize the codebase, documentation, and prepare for "release" (or next phase), **with a strong focus on responsible AI deployment, ongoing monitoring, and user feedback integration.**

## Tasks
1. **Code Cleanup**:
   - Run `dart fix`.
   - Remove unused imports/assets.
   - Format code.
2. **Documentation**:
   - Update `README.md` with setup instructions.
   - Ensure all `docs/` are up to date.
   - **New**: Document AI/LLM components, capabilities, disclaimers (e.g., "AI recommendations are for informational purposes and do not replace professional medical advice"), and guidelines for prompt engineering and model updates.
3. **Build Check**:
   - Run a release build (iOS/Android) to verify no compilation errors.
4. **Future Roadmap**:
   - Document plans for Backend integration (replacing Mock data).
5. **AI Deployment & Monitoring**:
   - Implement logging for AI interactions (e.g., successful/failed recipe generations, user feedback).
   - Set up monitoring for LLM API usage, performance, and cost.
   - Plan for continuous improvement of AI prompts and models based on collected data and user feedback.
   - Establish clear update and fallback strategies for LLM models/integrations.

### Backend Endpoints
- **None New**: Day 14 focuses on project finalization and preparation. The "Future Roadmap" explicitly notes backend integration as a next phase, which would leverage the endpoints identified in previous daily analyses.

## Checklist
- [ ] Codebase is clean and lint-free.
- [ ] README is clear.
- [ ] App builds successfully in release mode.
