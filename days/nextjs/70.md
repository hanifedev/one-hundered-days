# Day 70: DevOps - Infrastructure as Code and Cloud Platforms

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Understand IaC concepts and tools (Terraform, AWS CDK, Pulumi).
2.  **Cloud Platforms:** Learn about major cloud platforms (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) and their Next.js deployment options.
3.  **Serverless Deployment:** Understand serverless deployment options for Next.js (Vercel, AWS Lambda, Cloudflare Pages).
4.  **Infrastructure Automation:** Learn how to automate infrastructure provisioning and management.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Set up infrastructure as code for a Next.js application deployment (or use a cloud platform's Next.js integration).

## 📖 Task Explanations

Infrastructure as Code allows you to define and manage infrastructure using code, enabling version control, automation, and reproducibility. Understanding IaC is valuable for managing complex deployments and working with cloud platforms.

Cloud platforms offer various deployment options for Next.js, from fully managed (Vercel) to self-hosted (AWS, GCP, Azure). Understanding these options helps you choose the right platform for each use case. Serverless options provide automatic scaling and pay-per-use pricing.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand Infrastructure as Code and cloud platform options for Next.js. You'll know how to automate infrastructure and choose appropriate deployment platforms. This knowledge enables you to deploy applications to various cloud platforms and manage infrastructure professionally.
