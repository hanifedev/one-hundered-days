# Day 48: TypeScript - Advanced Next.js Type Patterns

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Next.js Type Utilities:** Learn Next.js-specific TypeScript patterns (typed routes, typed search params).
2.  **Server Component Types:** Understand TypeScript patterns for Server Components and async components.
3.  **Metadata Types:** Learn how to type metadata and ensure type safety in metadata generation.
4.  **Middleware Types:** Understand how to type middleware and typed request/response objects.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Apply advanced TypeScript patterns throughout a Next.js application for maximum type safety.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Next.js has specific TypeScript patterns that improve type safety. Typed routes ensure route parameters are type-safe. Server Components have specific typing requirements (async components, props). Understanding these patterns helps you leverage TypeScript effectively in Next.js.

Metadata and middleware also have specific typing requirements. Typed metadata ensures your SEO data is correct. Typed middleware ensures request/response handling is type-safe. These patterns are essential for building type-safe Next.js applications.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand advanced TypeScript patterns specific to Next.js. You'll know how to type routes, Server Components, metadata, and middleware. This knowledge enables you to build fully type-safe Next.js applications.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers
