# Day 22: Next.js App Router - Server Components and Client Components

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understanding Server Components:** Learn what Server Components are and their benefits (reduced bundle size, direct database access, improved performance).
2.  **Server Components by Default:** Understand that components in App Router are Server Components by default.
3.  **Client Components:** Learn when and how to use the `'use client'` directive to create Client Components.
4.  **Component Composition:** Learn how to use Server and Client Components together effectively.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Build a page that uses both Server Components (for data fetching) and Client Components (for interactivity).

## 📖 Task Explanations

Server Components are a revolutionary feature that allows React components to render on the server, reducing JavaScript sent to the client and improving performance. They can directly access databases and APIs without exposing sensitive information. Client Components are used when you need interactivity (useState, useEffect, event handlers).

Understanding when to use Server vs Client Components is crucial for building performant Next.js applications. Most of your components should be Server Components, with Client Components used only when necessary for interactivity.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand Server Components and Client Components in Next.js. You'll know when to use each type and how to compose them effectively. This knowledge enables you to build more performant applications with smaller bundle sizes.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Server Component:** A React component that renders on the server, reducing client-side JavaScript.
*   **Client Component:** A React component that renders on the client and can use React hooks and browser APIs.
*   **'use client' Directive:** A directive that marks a component and its children as Client Components.
*   **Bundle Size:** The amount of JavaScript code sent to the browser, affecting load time and performance.
*   **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** Rendering React components on the server before sending HTML to the client.
