# Day 73: Advanced Architecture - GraphQL and API Federation

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **GraphQL Introduction:** Understand what GraphQL is and how it differs from REST APIs.
2.  **GraphQL with Next.js:** Learn how to integrate GraphQL with Next.js (Apollo Client, urql, or native fetch).
3.  **GraphQL Server:** Build a GraphQL server (using libraries like Apollo Server, GraphQL Yoga) or integrate with existing GraphQL APIs.
4.  **API Federation:** Understand GraphQL federation for combining multiple GraphQL APIs.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Build a Next.js application that uses GraphQL for data fetching and mutations.

## 📖 Task Explanations

GraphQL provides a flexible API where clients request exactly the data they need. This reduces over-fetching and under-fetching common in REST APIs. GraphQL is valuable for applications with complex data requirements or multiple clients with different data needs.

API federation allows combining multiple GraphQL services into a single API, useful for microservices architectures. Understanding GraphQL helps you work with modern APIs and make informed decisions about API design.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand GraphQL and how to use it with Next.js applications. You'll know how to build GraphQL clients and servers, and understand API federation. This knowledge enables you to work with GraphQL APIs and make informed API design decisions.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **GraphQL:** A query language and runtime for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need.
*   **GraphQL Query:** A request for data in GraphQL, specifying exactly what fields to return.
*   **GraphQL Mutation:** A GraphQL operation that modifies data (create, update, delete).
*   **API Federation:** Combining multiple GraphQL services into a single, unified API.
*   **Schema:** The definition of available types, queries, and mutations in a GraphQL API.
