# Day 86: Team Collaboration - Git Workflows and Branching Strategies

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Git Workflows:** Understand different Git workflows (Git Flow, GitHub Flow, GitLab Flow) and when to use each.
2.  **Branching Strategies:** Learn effective branching strategies for team collaboration (feature branches, release branches, hotfixes).
3.  **Pull Request Best Practices:** Understand how to create effective pull requests (clear descriptions, small changes, proper testing).
4.  **Code Review Process:** Learn how to conduct and receive code reviews effectively.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Set up a Git workflow for a team project and practice the pull request process.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Effective Git workflows enable teams to collaborate efficiently. Different workflows suit different team sizes and release cycles. Feature branches allow parallel development. Pull requests enable code review and discussion before merging.

Good pull requests are small, focused, and well-documented. Code reviews catch bugs, share knowledge, and maintain code quality. Understanding these practices is essential for professional team collaboration.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand Git workflows and branching strategies for team collaboration. You'll know how to create effective pull requests and conduct code reviews. This knowledge enables you to work effectively in professional development teams.
