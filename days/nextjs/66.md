# Day 66: DevOps - CI/CD Pipelines and Automation

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **CI/CD Concepts:** Understand Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment principles.
2.  **GitHub Actions:** Set up comprehensive CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions for Next.js applications.
3.  **Automated Testing:** Configure automated testing in CI/CD pipelines (unit tests, integration tests, E2E tests).
4.  **Automated Deployment:** Set up automated deployment to staging and production environments.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Create a complete CI/CD pipeline for a Next.js application with testing and deployment automation.

## 📖 Task Explanations

CI/CD pipelines automate testing, building, and deploying applications. This saves time, reduces errors, and ensures code quality. GitHub Actions provides powerful CI/CD capabilities that integrate seamlessly with GitHub repositories.

Automated testing in CI/CD catches bugs before they reach production. Automated deployment ensures consistent, reliable deployments. Understanding CI/CD is essential for professional development workflows and team collaboration.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand how to set up comprehensive CI/CD pipelines for Next.js applications. You'll know how to automate testing and deployment. This knowledge enables you to work efficiently in professional development environments.
