# Day 93: Real-World Scenarios - Performance Issues and Optimization

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Performance Issue Identification:** Learn how to identify performance issues (slow page loads, high memory usage, poor Core Web Vitals).
2.  **Performance Analysis:** Use tools to analyze performance (Lighthouse, React DevTools, network tab, performance API).
3.  **Optimization Strategies:** Apply optimization strategies based on identified issues (code splitting, lazy loading, caching, database optimization).
4.  **Performance Budgets:** Understand performance budgets and how to maintain them.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Identify and fix performance issues in a Next.js application, measuring improvements.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Performance issues can significantly impact user experience and business metrics. Identifying issues requires understanding what to measure and how to measure it. Different issues require different optimization strategies. Performance budgets help maintain acceptable performance as applications grow.

Optimization should be data-driven—measure first, then optimize based on actual bottlenecks. Understanding performance analysis helps you make informed optimization decisions and measure improvements.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand how to identify and fix performance issues in Next.js applications. You'll know how to analyze performance and apply appropriate optimization strategies. This knowledge enables you to build and maintain fast applications.
