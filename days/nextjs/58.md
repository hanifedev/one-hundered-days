## 📖 Task Explanations

Headless CMSs provide content management without dictating how content is displayed. This is perfect for Next.js applications where you want content editors to manage content while developers control the presentation. Popular headless CMSs include Contentful, Strapi, and Sanity.

Content modeling is crucial—structuring content in a way that works well with your Next.js application. Content preview allows editors to see how content will look before publishing. Understanding CMS integration is valuable for content-driven applications.
