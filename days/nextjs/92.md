# Day 92: Real-World Scenarios - Debugging Complex Issues

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Debugging Methodology:** Learn a systematic approach to debugging (reproduce, isolate, identify, fix, verify).
2.  **Debugging Tools:** Master debugging tools (browser DevTools, React DevTools, Node.js debugger, logging).
3.  **Common Issues:** Understand how to debug common Next.js issues (hydration errors, build errors, runtime errors).
4.  **Production Debugging:** Learn techniques for debugging issues in production (error tracking, logging, monitoring).
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Debug a complex issue in a Next.js application, using systematic debugging techniques.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Debugging is a crucial skill for developers. A systematic approach helps you find and fix issues efficiently. Understanding debugging tools makes you more effective. Different issues require different approaches—hydration errors need different techniques than API errors.

Production debugging is especially challenging—you can't always reproduce issues locally. Error tracking, logging, and monitoring help identify production issues. Understanding these techniques is essential for maintaining production applications.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand how to debug complex issues systematically. You'll know how to use debugging tools and techniques for different types of issues. This knowledge enables you to solve problems efficiently and maintain production applications.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Debugging:** The process of finding and fixing bugs in code.
