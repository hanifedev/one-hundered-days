# Day 47: TypeScript - Type-Safe API and Database Patterns

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Type-Safe API Routes:** Learn how to create fully type-safe API routes in Next.js.
2.  **Prisma Type Safety:** Understand how to leverage Prisma's generated types for type-safe database operations.
3.  **API Response Types:** Create type-safe API responses and request handlers.
4. **Zod Integration:** Learn how to use Zod for runtime validation and type inference.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Build type-safe API routes with validation and type-safe database operations.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Type safety in APIs and databases prevents runtime errors and improves developer experience. Prisma generates TypeScript types from your schema, ensuring database operations are type-safe. Zod provides runtime validation that also infers TypeScript types, combining validation and type safety.

Type-safe APIs catch errors at compile time, reducing bugs and improving code quality. Understanding how to combine Prisma types, Zod validation, and TypeScript types creates a robust, type-safe backend. This is essential for building reliable applications.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand how to build type-safe APIs and database operations in Next.js. You'll know how to use Prisma types, Zod validation, and TypeScript effectively together. This knowledge enables you to build robust, type-safe full-stack applications.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Type-Safe API:** An API where types are enforced at compile time, preventing type-related errors.
*   **Prisma Types:** TypeScript types automatically generated from your Prisma schema.
*   **Zod:** A TypeScript-first schema validation library that infers types from schemas.
*   **Runtime Validation:** Validating data at runtime to ensure it matches expected types and constraints.
*   **Type Inference:** Automatically determining TypeScript types from validation schemas or other sources.
