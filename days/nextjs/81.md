# Day 81: Code Quality - Refactoring and Code Smells

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Code Smells:** Learn to identify code smells (duplicated code, long methods, large classes, magic numbers).
2.  **Refactoring Techniques:** Understand common refactoring techniques (extract method, extract component, rename, move).
3.  **Refactoring Safely:** Learn how to refactor code safely using tests and incremental changes.
4.  **Code Review:** Practice reviewing code and identifying areas for improvement.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Refactor an existing Next.js application, improving code quality and maintainability.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Code quality is essential for maintainable applications. Code smells indicate areas that need improvement. Refactoring improves code structure without changing functionality. Understanding refactoring techniques helps you improve code incrementally and safely.

Safe refactoring relies on tests to ensure behavior doesn't change. Code reviews help identify issues before they reach production. These practices are essential for professional development and team collaboration.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand how to identify and fix code quality issues. You'll know refactoring techniques and how to refactor safely. This knowledge enables you to maintain and improve codebases effectively.
