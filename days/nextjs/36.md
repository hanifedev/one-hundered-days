# Day 36: Production - Environment Configuration and Security

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Environment Variables:** Learn best practices for managing environment variables in Next.js (`.env.local`, `.env.production`).
2.  **Security Best Practices:** Understand security considerations for Next.js applications (API keys, secrets, CORS, CSRF).
3.  **Content Security Policy:** Learn how to configure Content Security Policy (CSP) headers.
4.  **Security Headers:** Understand important security headers and how to configure them in Next.js.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Configure environment variables and security headers for a production application.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Proper environment configuration is essential for deploying applications securely. Environment variables should be managed carefully, with different values for development, staging, and production. Security headers protect your application from common attacks like XSS, clickjacking, and data injection.

Understanding security best practices helps you build applications that protect user data and prevent vulnerabilities. Content Security Policy restricts what resources can be loaded, preventing XSS attacks. These practices are essential for production applications.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand how to configure environments securely and implement security best practices in Next.js applications. You'll know how to manage environment variables and configure security headers. This knowledge enables you to build secure, production-ready applications.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Environment Variable:** A variable whose value is set outside the application, typically for configuration.
*   **Security Header:** HTTP headers that provide security features (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.).
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** A security feature that helps prevent XSS attacks by restricting resource loading.
*   **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):** A mechanism that allows resources to be requested from different origins.
*   **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** An attack that tricks users into performing actions they didn't intend.
