# Day 37: Production - Monitoring and Error Tracking

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Error Tracking:** Learn how to set up error tracking using services like Sentry or LogRocket.
2.  **Error Boundaries:** Implement error boundaries to catch and handle errors gracefully.
3.  **Logging:** Understand best practices for logging in Next.js applications (server logs, client logs).
4.  **Performance Monitoring:** Set up performance monitoring to track application performance in production.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Set up error tracking and monitoring for an application and test error reporting.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Monitoring and error tracking are essential for maintaining production applications. Error tracking services help you identify and fix bugs quickly by providing detailed error reports, stack traces, and user context. Error boundaries prevent entire applications from crashing when errors occur.

Logging helps you understand what's happening in your application, but it's important to log appropriately (not too much, not too little) and handle sensitive information carefully. Performance monitoring helps you identify performance issues in production and measure improvements.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand how to set up monitoring and error tracking for Next.js applications. You'll know how to implement error boundaries and configure logging. This knowledge enables you to maintain and debug production applications effectively.
