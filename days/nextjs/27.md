# Day 27: Performance Optimization - Bundle Analysis and Code Splitting

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Bundle Analysis:** Learn how to analyze your Next.js bundle size using `@next/bundle-analyzer`.
2.  **Understanding Bundle Size:** Identify large dependencies and understand their impact on performance.
3.  **Code Splitting:** Learn how Next.js automatically code splits and how to optimize it further.
4.  **Dynamic Imports:** Use dynamic imports with `next/dynamic` to lazy load components.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Analyze an application's bundle, identify optimization opportunities, and implement code splitting.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Bundle size directly affects how fast your application loads. Large bundles mean slower initial page loads, especially on mobile devices. Bundle analysis helps you identify what's making your bundle large and where to optimize. Next.js automatically code splits by route, but you can optimize further with dynamic imports.

Dynamic imports allow you to load components only when needed, reducing initial bundle size. This is especially useful for heavy components, modals, or features that aren't immediately visible. Understanding bundle analysis and code splitting is essential for building performant applications.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand how to analyze and optimize bundle size in Next.js applications. You'll know how to use dynamic imports and identify optimization opportunities. This knowledge enables you to build applications that load quickly and efficiently.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Bundle Size:** The total size of JavaScript code in your application, affecting download and execution time.
*   **Bundle Analysis:** The process of examining what's included in your JavaScript bundle to identify optimization opportunities.
*   **Code Splitting:** Breaking code into smaller chunks that are loaded on demand, reducing initial bundle size.
*   **Dynamic Import:** Loading a module or component only when it's needed, rather than including it in the initial bundle.
*   **Lazy Loading:** Loading code or components only when they're needed, improving initial load time.
