# Day 67: DevOps - Docker and Containerization

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Docker Basics:** Understand what Docker is and why it's useful for application deployment.
2.  **Dockerfile Creation:** Learn how to create Dockerfiles for Next.js applications.
3.  **Multi-Stage Builds:** Understand multi-stage Docker builds for optimizing image size.
4.  **Docker Compose:** Learn how to use Docker Compose for local development with databases and other services.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Containerize a Next.js application and set up Docker Compose for local development.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Docker containerizes applications, ensuring they run consistently across different environments. This is valuable for deployment, local development, and team collaboration. Understanding Docker is essential for modern deployment practices and working with container orchestration platforms.

Multi-stage builds reduce Docker image size by separating build and runtime environments. Docker Compose simplifies running multiple services (app, database, Redis) together. These skills are valuable for professional development and deployment.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand how to containerize Next.js applications using Docker. You'll know how to create Dockerfiles, use multi-stage builds, and set up Docker Compose. This knowledge enables you to deploy applications consistently and work with container-based infrastructure.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers
