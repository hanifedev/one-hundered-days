# Day 49: TypeScript - Type-Safe State Management

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Typed State Management:** Learn how to create type-safe state management solutions (Zustand, Redux Toolkit).
2.  **Type Inference in State:** Understand how to leverage TypeScript inference in state management.
3.  **Action Types:** Create type-safe actions and reducers in state management libraries.
4.  **Context Types:** Learn how to type React Context and Context Providers for type safety.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Refactor state management in an application to be fully type-safe.

## 📖 Task Explanations

State management libraries like Zustand and Redux Toolkit provide excellent TypeScript support. Understanding how to type state, actions, and selectors ensures type safety throughout your application. Type inference reduces boilerplate while maintaining safety.

Context API also benefits from proper typing. Typed Context ensures consumers receive correctly typed values. Understanding these patterns helps you build type-safe state management that catches errors at compile time.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand how to create type-safe state management in Next.js applications. You'll know how to type Zustand stores, Redux slices, and React Context. This knowledge enables you to build applications with fully type-safe state management.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Type-Safe State:** State management where types are enforced, preventing type-related errors.
*   **Typed Action:** An action in state management that has TypeScript types for its payload and type.
*   **Typed Selector:** A function that selects state with TypeScript types ensuring type safety.
*   **Context Type:** TypeScript types for React Context ensuring consumers receive correctly typed values.
*   **State Type Inference:** Automatically determining TypeScript types from state management setup.
