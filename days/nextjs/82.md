# Day 82: Code Quality - Design Patterns in Next.js

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Design Patterns:** Understand common design patterns and when to use them (Singleton, Factory, Observer, Strategy).
2.  **React Patterns:** Learn React-specific patterns (Higher-Order Components, Render Props, Custom Hooks, Compound Components).
3.  **Next.js Patterns:** Understand Next.js-specific patterns (Layout patterns, Data fetching patterns, Error handling patterns).
4.  **Pattern Selection:** Learn when to use which pattern and when to avoid over-engineering.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Implement design patterns in a Next.js application where they provide value.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems. Understanding patterns helps you write better code and communicate design decisions. However, patterns should be used when they add value, not just because they exist.

React and Next.js have specific patterns that are valuable for building applications. Understanding these patterns helps you write idiomatic code and solve problems effectively. Knowing when not to use patterns is as important as knowing when to use them.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand common design patterns and how to apply them in Next.js applications. You'll know React and Next.js-specific patterns and when to use them. This knowledge enables you to write better, more maintainable code.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Design Pattern:** A reusable solution to a common problem in software design.
*   **Higher-Order Component (HOC):** A function that takes a component and returns a new component with additional functionality.
*   **Render Props:** A pattern where a component accepts a function as a prop to render content.
*   **Compound Component:** A pattern where multiple components work together to form a complete UI.
*   **Idiomatic Code:** Code that follows the conventions and patterns of a particular language or framework.
