# Day 78: Specialized Topics - Serverless Functions and Edge Computing

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Serverless Concepts:** Understand serverless computing and its benefits (automatic scaling, pay-per-use, no server management).
2.  **Next.js API Routes as Serverless:** Learn how Next.js API routes work as serverless functions on platforms like Vercel.
3.  **Edge Functions:** Understand Edge Functions and how to use them with Next.js for low-latency operations.
4.  **Serverless Patterns:** Learn common serverless patterns (function composition, event-driven, scheduled tasks).
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Build serverless functions and edge functions for a Next.js application.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Serverless computing allows you to run code without managing servers. Next.js API routes automatically become serverless functions on platforms like Vercel. Edge Functions run at edge locations worldwide, providing low latency for simple operations.

Serverless is valuable for APIs, background jobs, and event processing. Understanding serverless helps you build scalable applications without infrastructure management. Edge Functions are perfect for lightweight operations that benefit from low latency.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand serverless computing and how to use it with Next.js. You'll know how to build serverless functions and edge functions. This knowledge enables you to build scalable applications without managing infrastructure.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Serverless:** A cloud computing model where you run code without managing servers, with automatic scaling.
*   **Serverless Function:** A function that runs in a serverless environment, scaling automatically based on demand.
*   **Edge Function:** A serverless function that runs at edge locations worldwide for low latency.
*   **Function as a Service (FaaS):** A cloud service that executes functions in response to events.
*   **Pay-Per-Use:** A pricing model where you only pay for the compute resources you actually use.
