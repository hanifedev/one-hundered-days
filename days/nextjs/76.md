# Day 76: Specialized Topics - Accessibility (a11y) and Inclusive Design

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Accessibility Basics:** Understand web accessibility principles (WCAG guidelines, ARIA attributes, semantic HTML).
2.  **Next.js Accessibility:** Learn how to build accessible Next.js applications (keyboard navigation, screen readers, focus management).
3.  **Testing Accessibility:** Use tools to test accessibility (axe DevTools, Lighthouse, manual testing).
4.  **Inclusive Design:** Understand inclusive design principles and how to design for all users.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Audit and improve accessibility in an existing Next.js application.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Accessibility ensures applications are usable by people with disabilities. This includes keyboard navigation, screen reader support, proper color contrast, and semantic HTML. Building accessible applications is not just ethical—it's often required by law and improves usability for all users.

Inclusive design considers diverse user needs from the start. Understanding accessibility helps you build applications that work for everyone. Testing tools help identify accessibility issues, but manual testing with assistive technologies is also important.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand how to build accessible Next.js applications. You'll know accessibility principles, testing methods, and inclusive design. This knowledge enables you to build applications that are usable by everyone.
