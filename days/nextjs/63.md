# Day 63: Advanced Next.js - Route Handlers and Advanced API Patterns

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Route Handlers:** Learn how to create route handlers in App Router using `route.ts` files.
2.  **HTTP Methods:** Understand how to handle different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH) in route handlers.
3.  **Request/Response APIs:** Learn Next.js's extended Request and Response APIs for advanced use cases.
4.  **API Patterns:** Implement common API patterns (RESTful APIs, error handling, validation, rate limiting).
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Build a comprehensive API using route handlers with proper error handling and validation.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Route handlers in App Router provide a modern way to create API endpoints. They support all HTTP methods and provide access to extended Request/Response APIs. Understanding route handlers is essential for building APIs in Next.js, whether for internal use or external consumption.

Good API design includes proper error handling, validation, and potentially rate limiting. These patterns ensure your APIs are robust, secure, and provide good developer experience. Understanding these patterns helps you build production-ready APIs.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand how to create route handlers and build robust APIs in Next.js. You'll know how to handle different HTTP methods, implement error handling, and follow API best practices. This knowledge enables you to build production-ready APIs.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Route Handler:** An API endpoint in Next.js App Router created using `route.ts` files.
*   **HTTP Method:** The type of request (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) that determines the operation.
*   **Request API:** Next.js's extended Request API that provides additional functionality beyond standard fetch.
*   **Response API:** Next.js's extended Response API for creating responses with additional features.
*   **RESTful API:** An API that follows REST principles for designing web services.
