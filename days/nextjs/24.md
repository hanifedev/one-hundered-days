# Day 24: Next.js App Router - Loading States and Error Handling

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Loading UI:** Learn how to create loading states using `loading.tsx` files in App Router.
2.  **Error Boundaries:** Understand how to handle errors using `error.tsx` files.
3.  **Suspense Boundaries:** Learn how to use React Suspense for granular loading states.
4.  **Streaming:** Understand how Next.js streams HTML to improve perceived performance.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Build a page with loading states, error handling, and streaming for optimal user experience.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Loading and error states are essential for good user experience. App Router provides special files (`loading.tsx`, `error.tsx`) that automatically handle these states for routes. Suspense allows you to create more granular loading states, showing parts of the page while other parts are still loading.

Streaming allows Next.js to send HTML to the browser incrementally as it's generated, improving perceived performance. Users see content faster, even if the entire page isn't ready. Understanding these patterns helps you build applications that feel fast and responsive.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand how to handle loading and error states in App Router. You'll know how to use Suspense and streaming to improve user experience. This knowledge enables you to build applications that provide excellent feedback to users.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Loading State:** A UI state that indicates content is being fetched or processed.
*   **Error Boundary:** A React component that catches errors in its child components and displays a fallback UI.
*   **Suspense:** A React feature that allows you to show fallback UI while components are loading.
*   **Streaming:** Sending HTML to the browser incrementally as it's generated, improving perceived performance.
*   **Perceived Performance:** How fast an application feels to users, not just actual load time.
