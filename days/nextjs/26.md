# Day 26: Performance Optimization - Image and Font Optimization

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Next.js Image Component:** Learn how to use the `next/image` component for optimized images.
2.  **Image Optimization Features:** Understand automatic image optimization (format conversion, responsive images, lazy loading).
3.  **Font Optimization:** Learn how to use `next/font` to optimize font loading and reduce layout shift.
4.  **Font Strategies:** Understand different font loading strategies (variable fonts, font subsets, display swap).
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Optimize images and fonts in an existing application to improve performance metrics.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Images and fonts are often the largest assets on web pages and can significantly impact performance. Next.js Image component automatically optimizes images (converting formats, generating responsive sizes, lazy loading) without additional configuration. Font optimization reduces layout shift and improves load times.

Understanding these optimizations is crucial for building fast applications. The Next.js Image component alone can dramatically improve performance by serving appropriately sized images and using modern formats like WebP. Font optimization prevents invisible text during font loading.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand how to optimize images and fonts in Next.js applications. You'll know how to use the Image component and font optimization features. This knowledge enables you to build applications that load quickly and provide excellent user experience.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Image Optimization:** Techniques for reducing image file size and improving load time while maintaining quality.
*   **Responsive Images:** Images that are served in different sizes based on the user's device and screen size.
*   **Lazy Loading:** Loading images only when they're about to enter the viewport, improving initial page load.
*   **Font Optimization:** Techniques for reducing font file size and improving font loading performance.
*   **Layout Shift:** When page elements move unexpectedly during loading, causing poor user experience.
