# Day 59: Enterprise Features - Advanced Deployment and Infrastructure

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Infrastructure as Code:** Learn how to define infrastructure using code (Terraform, AWS CDK, Pulumi).
2.  **Multi-Region Deployment:** Understand how to deploy Next.js applications across multiple regions for better performance.
3.  **CDN Configuration:** Learn how to configure CDNs for optimal performance and caching.
4.  **Database Replication:** Understand database replication strategies for high availability and performance.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Set up advanced infrastructure for a Next.js application (multi-region, CDN, monitoring).

## 📖 Task Explanations

Advanced deployment and infrastructure are essential for enterprise applications. Infrastructure as Code allows you to version control and automate infrastructure setup. Multi-region deployment improves performance and availability by serving users from nearby regions.

CDN configuration optimizes content delivery. Database replication provides high availability and can improve read performance. Understanding these concepts helps you build applications that scale globally and remain available even during failures.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand advanced deployment and infrastructure patterns for Next.js applications. You'll know how to set up multi-region deployments, configure CDNs, and plan for high availability. This knowledge enables you to build applications that scale globally.
