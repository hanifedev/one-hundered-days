# Day 68: DevOps - Kubernetes and Container Orchestration

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Kubernetes Basics:** Understand what Kubernetes is and when to use it for application deployment.
2.  **Kubernetes Concepts:** Learn core Kubernetes concepts (pods, services, deployments, ingress).
3.  **Next.js on Kubernetes:** Learn how to deploy Next.js applications to Kubernetes.
4.  **Scaling and Management:** Understand how to scale applications and manage deployments in Kubernetes.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Deploy a Next.js application to Kubernetes (or a local Kubernetes cluster like Minikube).

## 📖 Task Explanations

Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform that manages containerized applications at scale. It's essential for large-scale deployments, providing features like automatic scaling, load balancing, and self-healing. Understanding Kubernetes is valuable for enterprise deployments and working with cloud platforms.

While Kubernetes has a learning curve, understanding its concepts helps you work with managed Kubernetes services (like AWS EKS, Google GKE, Azure AKS). Even if you don't manage Kubernetes directly, understanding it helps you work with DevOps teams and cloud platforms.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand Kubernetes basics and how to deploy Next.js applications to Kubernetes. You'll know core Kubernetes concepts and deployment patterns. This knowledge enables you to work with container orchestration and enterprise deployment platforms.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers
