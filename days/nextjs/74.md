# Day 74: Advanced Architecture - Caching Strategies and CDN

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Caching Layers:** Understand different caching layers (browser, CDN, application, database) and their use cases.
2.  **CDN Configuration:** Learn how to configure CDNs (Cloudflare, AWS CloudFront, Vercel Edge Network) for Next.js.
3.  **Cache Invalidation:** Understand strategies for invalidating caches when data changes.
4.  **Edge Caching:** Learn about edge caching and how to use it effectively with Next.js.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Implement comprehensive caching strategies for a Next.js application (CDN, application cache, database cache).

## 📖 Task Explanations

Effective caching dramatically improves application performance and reduces server load. Understanding different caching layers helps you optimize at each level. CDNs cache content close to users, reducing latency. Application caching reduces database queries. Database caching improves query performance.

Cache invalidation is crucial—stale data can cause issues. Understanding when and how to invalidate caches ensures data freshness while maintaining performance benefits. These strategies are essential for high-performance applications.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand comprehensive caching strategies for Next.js applications. You'll know how to configure CDNs, implement application caching, and handle cache invalidation. This knowledge enables you to build highly performant applications.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **CDN (Content Delivery Network):** A network of servers that cache and deliver content from locations close to users.
*   **Cache Layer:** A level in the caching system (browser, CDN, application, database) where data is stored.
*   **Cache Invalidation:** The process of marking cached data as stale and requiring an update.
*   **Edge Caching:** Caching content at edge locations (close to users) for faster delivery.
*   **Cache Strategy:** A plan for what to cache, where to cache it, and when to invalidate it.
