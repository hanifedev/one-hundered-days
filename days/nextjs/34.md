# Day 34: Advanced Patterns - Internationalization (i18n)

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understanding i18n:** Learn what internationalization is and why it's important for global applications.
2.  **Next.js i18n:** Understand Next.js's built-in internationalization features and routing.
3.  **Locale Configuration:** Set up locale configuration and routing for multiple languages.
4.  **Translation Management:** Learn how to manage translations using libraries like `next-intl` or `react-i18next`.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Implement internationalization in an application, supporting at least two languages.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Internationalization (i18n) allows your application to support multiple languages and regions. Next.js provides built-in support for locale routing, making it easy to create multilingual applications. Understanding i18n is essential for building applications that serve global audiences.

Translation management can be handled with libraries that provide features like pluralization, date/number formatting, and translation loading. Implementing i18n properly improves user experience for international users and can increase your application's reach.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand how to implement internationalization in Next.js applications. You'll know how to set up locale routing and manage translations. This knowledge enables you to build applications that serve global audiences.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Internationalization (i18n):** The process of designing and developing applications that can be adapted to different languages and regions.
*   **Locale:** A combination of language and region (e.g., `en-US`, `fr-FR`, `es-ES`).
*   **Locale Routing:** URL-based routing that includes the locale (e.g., `/en/about`, `/fr/about`).
*   **Translation:** The process of converting text from one language to another.
*   **Localization (l10n):** The process of adapting an application for a specific locale (formatting dates, numbers, etc.).
