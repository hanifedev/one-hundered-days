# Day 91: Real-World Scenarios - Legacy Code and Technical Debt

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understanding Legacy Code:** Learn how to work with legacy codebases (old patterns, outdated dependencies, unclear structure).
2.  **Technical Debt Management:** Understand how to identify, prioritize, and address technical debt.
3.  **Incremental Improvement:** Learn strategies for improving legacy code incrementally without breaking functionality.
4.  **Migration Strategies:** Understand how to migrate from old patterns to new ones (Pages Router to App Router, class components to hooks).
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Work with a legacy Next.js codebase, identifying issues and planning improvements.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Most developers work with legacy code at some point. Legacy code can be challenging—it may use outdated patterns, have unclear structure, or lack tests. Understanding how to work with legacy code is essential for professional development.

Technical debt accumulates over time. Managing it requires identifying what needs improvement, prioritizing based on impact, and addressing it incrementally. Migration strategies help move from old to new patterns safely. These skills are valuable in real-world development.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand how to work with legacy code and manage technical debt. You'll know strategies for incremental improvement and migration. This knowledge enables you to work effectively with existing codebases and improve them over time.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Legacy Code:** Code that is old, may use outdated patterns, and is difficult to modify.
*   **Technical Debt:** The implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing quick solutions over better approaches.
*   **Incremental Improvement:** Making small, continuous improvements to code rather than large rewrites.
*   **Migration:** Moving from one technology, pattern, or approach to another.
*   **Code Modernization:** Updating legacy code to use modern patterns and practices.
