# Day 25: Next.js App Router - Advanced Routing

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Dynamic Routes:** Learn how to create dynamic routes using `[slug]` folders and `params`.
2.  **Route Groups:** Understand how to use route groups `(folder)` to organize routes without affecting the URL structure.
3.  **Parallel Routes:** Learn about parallel routes using `@folder` syntax for conditional layouts.
4.  **Intercepting Routes:** Understand how to use `(.)folder` syntax to intercept routes and show modals.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Build a complex routing structure using dynamic routes, route groups, and intercepting routes.

## 📖 Task Explanations

App Router provides powerful routing features beyond basic pages. Dynamic routes allow you to create pages for dynamic content (like blog posts, user profiles). Route groups help organize your code without affecting URLs. Parallel routes enable conditional layouts (like dashboards with different sidebars).

Intercepting routes allow you to show modals or different UI for the same route, creating sophisticated navigation patterns. Understanding these advanced routing features enables you to build complex, professional applications.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand advanced routing patterns in App Router. You'll be able to create dynamic routes, use route groups, and implement intercepting routes. This knowledge enables you to build complex, well-organized applications.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Dynamic Route:** A route that matches multiple URLs using parameters (e.g., `/posts/[id]`).
*   **Route Group:** A way to organize routes in folders without affecting the URL structure using `(folder)` syntax.
*   **Parallel Route:** A route that renders simultaneously with other routes using `@folder` syntax.
*   **Intercepting Route:** A route that intercepts navigation to show different UI (like modals) using `(.)folder` syntax.
*   **Route Parameter:** A dynamic segment in a URL that can be accessed in the component (e.g., `params.id`).
