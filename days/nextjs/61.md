# Day 61: Advanced Next.js - Streaming and Partial Prerendering

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understanding Streaming:** Learn what streaming is and how Next.js streams HTML to improve perceived performance.
2.  **Suspense and Streaming:** Understand how React Suspense enables streaming in Next.js.
3.  **Partial Prerendering:** Learn about Partial Prerendering (PPR) and how it combines static and dynamic rendering.
4.  **Streaming Patterns:** Implement streaming patterns for optimal performance (loading states, progressive enhancement).
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Build a page that uses streaming and Partial Prerendering for optimal performance.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Streaming allows Next.js to send HTML to the browser incrementally as it's generated, rather than waiting for the entire page. This improves perceived performance—users see content faster. Partial Prerendering combines the benefits of static generation with dynamic content, prerendering static parts while streaming dynamic parts.

Understanding streaming is essential for building fast applications. It's especially valuable for pages with slow data fetching, as users see the page structure immediately while data loads. These features represent the cutting edge of Next.js performance optimization.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand streaming and Partial Prerendering in Next.js. You'll know how to implement these features for optimal performance. This knowledge enables you to build applications that feel instant and provide excellent user experience.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Streaming:** Sending HTML to the browser incrementally as it's generated, rather than waiting for the complete page.
*   **Partial Prerendering (PPR):** A feature that combines static prerendering with dynamic streaming for optimal performance.
*   **Perceived Performance:** How fast an application feels to users, not just actual load time.
*   **Progressive Enhancement:** Building applications that work without JavaScript but are enhanced when JavaScript is available.
*   **Incremental Rendering:** Rendering content progressively as it becomes available.
