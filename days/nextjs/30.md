# Day 30: Performance Optimization - Practice Project

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Project Goal:** Optimize an existing Next.js application for performance.
2.  **Performance Audit:** Conduct a comprehensive performance audit (bundle analysis, Core Web Vitals, Lighthouse scores).
3.  **Implement Optimizations:** Apply performance optimizations (image optimization, code splitting, caching, font optimization).
4.  **Measure Improvements:** Measure the impact of optimizations on performance metrics.
5.  **Documentation:** Document the optimizations made and their impact on performance.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today you'll consolidate all your performance optimization knowledge by optimizing a real application. This project should demonstrate your ability to identify performance issues, implement optimizations, and measure improvements. Performance optimization is an iterative process that requires measurement and refinement.

A well-optimized application loads quickly, provides excellent user experience, and ranks well in search. This project showcases your ability to build production-ready, performant applications and will be valuable for your portfolio.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have optimized a Next.js application for performance. You'll have practical experience with performance auditing, implementing optimizations, and measuring improvements. This project demonstrates your ability to build fast, efficient applications.
