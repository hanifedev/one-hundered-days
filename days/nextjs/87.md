# Day 87: Team Collaboration - Documentation and Knowledge Sharing

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Documentation Types:** Understand different types of documentation (API docs, architecture docs, README, code comments).
2.  **Writing Effective Documentation:** Learn how to write clear, useful documentation that helps developers understand and use code.
3.  **Code Comments:** Understand when and how to write helpful code comments (explaining why, not what).
4.  **Knowledge Sharing:** Learn techniques for sharing knowledge with teams (documentation, pair programming, tech talks).
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Create comprehensive documentation for a Next.js project (README, API docs, architecture overview).

## 📖 Task Explanations

Good documentation helps teams understand code, onboard new members, and maintain applications. Different types of documentation serve different purposes. API docs help consumers use APIs. Architecture docs explain system design. README files help developers get started.

Code comments should explain why code exists, not what it does (code should be self-documenting). Knowledge sharing helps teams learn and grow together. Understanding documentation practices is essential for professional development.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand how to create effective documentation for Next.js projects. You'll know different documentation types and how to write helpful code comments. This knowledge enables you to contribute to team knowledge and maintainability.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Documentation:** Written information that explains how code works and how to use it.
*   **API Documentation:** Documentation that explains how to use an API, including endpoints, parameters, and examples.
*   **Architecture Documentation:** Documentation that explains the overall structure and design of an application.
*   **Self-Documenting Code:** Code that is clear enough that it doesn't need extensive comments.
*   **Knowledge Sharing:** The process of sharing information and expertise with team members.
