# Day 31: Advanced Patterns - Middleware and Edge Functions

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understanding Middleware:** Learn what Next.js middleware is and when to use it.
2.  **Middleware Implementation:** Create middleware using `middleware.ts` to handle requests before they reach your pages.
3.  **Common Use Cases:** Implement common middleware patterns (authentication, redirects, header modification, A/B testing).
4.  **Edge Runtime:** Understand the Edge Runtime and when to use it for better performance.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Build middleware for authentication, redirects, and request modification.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Middleware in Next.js runs before a request is completed, allowing you to modify the request or response. It's perfect for authentication, redirects, header modification, and other cross-cutting concerns. Middleware runs on the Edge Runtime, which provides low latency by running close to users.

Understanding middleware is essential for building secure, performant applications. It allows you to handle authentication and authorization at the edge, before requests reach your application code. Edge Runtime provides better performance for simple operations that don't need Node.js APIs.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand Next.js middleware and how to use it for common patterns. You'll know when to use Edge Runtime and how to implement middleware for authentication and other use cases. This knowledge enables you to build more secure and performant applications.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Middleware:** Code that runs before a request is completed, allowing you to modify the request or response.
*   **Edge Runtime:** A lightweight runtime that runs code at the edge (close to users) for low latency.
*   **Request Interception:** The process of intercepting and modifying requests before they reach your application.
*   **Cross-Cutting Concern:** Functionality that applies across multiple parts of an application (like authentication).
*   **Edge Function:** A function that runs on the Edge Runtime for improved performance and lower latency.
