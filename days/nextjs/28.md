# Day 28: Performance Optimization - Caching and Revalidation Strategies

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Caching Layers:** Understand Next.js's multiple caching layers (Request Memoization, Data Cache, Full Route Cache, Router Cache).
2.  **Cache Configuration:** Learn how to configure caching at different levels (fetch options, route segment config).
3.  **Revalidation Strategies:** Understand different revalidation methods (time-based, on-demand, tag-based).
4.  **Cache Invalidation:** Learn how to invalidate caches when data changes.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Implement different caching strategies in an application and measure their impact on performance.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Next.js has a sophisticated caching system that improves performance by storing data and rendered pages. Understanding the different caching layers helps you optimize your application effectively. Each layer serves a different purpose and has different invalidation strategies.

Revalidation allows you to update cached data without rebuilding everything. Time-based revalidation updates data periodically, on-demand revalidation updates when triggered, and tag-based revalidation provides fine-grained control. Understanding these strategies is crucial for building fast, up-to-date applications.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand Next.js's caching system and how to use it effectively. You'll know different revalidation strategies and when to use each. This knowledge enables you to build applications that are both fast and have fresh data.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Caching Layer:** A level in the caching system where data is stored (request, data, route, router).
*   **Request Memoization:** Caching the result of fetch requests during a single render pass.
*   **Data Cache:** Persistent cache for fetch requests across requests and builds.
*   **Revalidation:** The process of updating cached data to ensure it's fresh.
*   **Cache Invalidation:** The process of marking cached data as stale and requiring an update.
