# Day 72: Advanced Architecture - Event-Driven Architecture

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Event-Driven Architecture:** Understand event-driven architecture and when to use it.
2.  **Event Patterns:** Learn common event patterns (pub/sub, event sourcing, CQRS).
3.  **Message Queues:** Understand message queues (RabbitMQ, AWS SQS, Redis) and their use cases.
4.  **Next.js Integration:** Learn how to integrate event-driven patterns with Next.js applications.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Design and implement an event-driven feature in a Next.js application.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Event-driven architecture decouples services by having them communicate through events rather than direct calls. This improves scalability, resilience, and allows services to evolve independently. Message queues enable reliable event delivery and processing.

Event-driven patterns are valuable for large applications with multiple services. Understanding these patterns helps you build scalable, maintainable architectures. While Next.js applications typically use request/response, integrating with event-driven backends is common.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand event-driven architecture and how to integrate it with Next.js applications. You'll know event patterns and message queue concepts. This knowledge enables you to design scalable architectures and work with event-driven systems.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Event-Driven Architecture:** An architectural pattern where services communicate through events rather than direct calls.
*   **Pub/Sub (Publish/Subscribe):** A messaging pattern where publishers send messages to channels and subscribers receive them.
*   **Message Queue:** A service that stores and delivers messages between applications or services.
*   **Event Sourcing:** Storing all changes as a sequence of events rather than current state.
*   **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):** Separating read and write operations for better scalability.
