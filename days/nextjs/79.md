# Day 79: Specialized Topics - Machine Learning Integration

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **ML in Web Apps:** Understand how machine learning can be integrated into Next.js applications.
2.  **Client-Side ML:** Learn about running ML models in the browser (TensorFlow.js, ONNX.js).
3.  **Server-Side ML:** Understand how to use ML APIs and services in Next.js (OpenAI, Google Cloud AI).
4.  **Use Cases:** Explore ML use cases in web applications (recommendations, image recognition, natural language processing).
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Integrate an ML feature into a Next.js application (recommendations, sentiment analysis, or image classification).

## 📖 Task Explanations

Machine learning can enhance web applications with intelligent features like recommendations, content moderation, image recognition, and natural language processing. Client-side ML runs models in the browser for privacy and speed. Server-side ML uses APIs or services for more powerful models.

Understanding ML integration helps you build applications with intelligent features. While you don't need to be an ML expert, understanding how to integrate ML services and APIs is valuable for modern applications.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand how to integrate machine learning into Next.js applications. You'll know when to use client-side vs. server-side ML and how to integrate ML services. This knowledge enables you to build applications with intelligent features.
