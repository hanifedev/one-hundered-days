# Day 77: Specialized Topics - Progressive Web Apps (PWA)

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **PWA Concepts:** Understand what Progressive Web Apps are and their benefits (offline support, installable, push notifications).
2.  **Service Workers:** Learn how to implement service workers in Next.js for offline functionality and caching.
3.  **Web App Manifest:** Create a web app manifest to make your Next.js app installable.
4.  **PWA Features:** Implement PWA features (offline support, push notifications, background sync).
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Convert a Next.js application into a PWA with offline support and installability.

## 📖 Task Explanations

PWAs combine the best of web and mobile apps—they're installable, work offline, and can send push notifications. Service workers enable offline functionality and advanced caching. Web app manifests make apps installable on devices.

PWAs are valuable for applications that benefit from app-like experiences (e-commerce, productivity apps, social media). Understanding PWAs helps you build applications that work well on mobile devices and provide native app-like experiences.
