# Day 50: TypeScript - Practice Project

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Project Goal:** Build or refactor a Next.js application with comprehensive TypeScript coverage.
2.  **Type Safety:** Ensure all code is type-safe (components, API routes, database operations, state management).
3.  **Advanced Types:** Use advanced TypeScript features (generics, utility types, conditional types) where appropriate.
4.  **Type Organization:** Organize types effectively (shared types, domain types, API types).
5.  **Documentation:** Document type decisions and patterns used in the project.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today you'll consolidate all your TypeScript knowledge by building or refactoring an application with comprehensive type safety. This project should demonstrate your ability to use TypeScript effectively throughout a Next.js application, from components to APIs to database operations.

A well-typed application catches errors at compile time, improves developer experience, and serves as documentation. This project showcases your TypeScript skills and demonstrates your ability to build robust, type-safe applications.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have built or refactored a Next.js application with comprehensive TypeScript coverage. You'll have practical experience with advanced TypeScript features and type-safe patterns. This project demonstrates your ability to build robust, type-safe applications.
