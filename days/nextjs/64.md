# Day 64: Advanced Next.js - Custom Server and Advanced Configuration

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Custom Server:** Learn when and how to use a custom server with Next.js (Express, Fastify, etc.).
2.  **Server Configuration:** Understand advanced Next.js configuration options (`next.config.js`).
3.  **Webpack Configuration:** Learn how to customize Webpack configuration in Next.js (when needed).
4.  **Experimental Features:** Understand Next.js experimental features and when to use them.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Set up a custom server or configure advanced Next.js settings for a specific use case.

## 📖 Task Explanations

While Next.js's default server is sufficient for most use cases, sometimes you need a custom server for specific requirements (WebSocket support, custom middleware, legacy integrations). Understanding when and how to use a custom server is valuable for edge cases.

Next.js configuration allows extensive customization. Understanding configuration options helps you optimize builds, customize behavior, and enable experimental features. These skills are valuable for advanced use cases and specific requirements.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand when and how to use custom servers and advanced Next.js configuration. You'll know how to customize Next.js behavior for specific requirements. This knowledge enables you to handle advanced use cases and optimize Next.js for your needs.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Custom Server:** A custom Node.js server (Express, Fastify, etc.) that runs Next.js instead of using the default server.
*   **Next.js Configuration:** Settings in `next.config.js` that customize Next.js behavior (build, routing, etc.).
*   **Webpack Configuration:** Customizing the Webpack bundler used by Next.js (rarely needed but possible).
*   **Experimental Features:** Features in Next.js that are not yet stable but available for testing.
*   **Server Customization:** Modifying server behavior beyond Next.js defaults for specific requirements.
