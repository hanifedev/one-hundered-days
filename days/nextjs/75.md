# Day 75: Advanced Architecture - Practice Project

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Project Goal:** Build a Next.js application using advanced architectural patterns (micro-frontends, event-driven, GraphQL, or comprehensive caching).
2.  **Architecture Design:** Design the application architecture, choosing appropriate patterns for the use case.
3.  **Implementation:** Implement the architecture with proper separation of concerns and scalability in mind.
4.  **Documentation:** Document the architecture, design decisions, and how different parts interact.
5.  **Review:** Review the architecture and identify areas for improvement or optimization.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today you'll consolidate your advanced architecture knowledge by building an application with sophisticated architecture. This project should demonstrate your ability to choose appropriate patterns, implement them correctly, and document architectural decisions.

Good architecture balances complexity with benefits. Understanding when to use advanced patterns (and when not to) is as important as knowing how to implement them. This project showcases your architectural thinking and will be valuable for your portfolio.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have built a Next.js application with advanced architecture. You'll have practical experience with architectural patterns and decision-making. This project demonstrates your ability to design and implement sophisticated architectures.
