# Day 84: Code Quality - Security Best Practices

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Security Fundamentals:** Understand common web security vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, SQL injection, authentication flaws).
2.  **Next.js Security:** Learn Next.js security features and best practices (CSP headers, secure cookies, environment variables).
3.  **Input Validation:** Implement proper input validation and sanitization to prevent attacks.
4.  **Security Headers:** Configure security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options) in Next.js.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Audit and improve security in a Next.js application, implementing security best practices.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Security is crucial for production applications. Understanding common vulnerabilities helps you prevent them. Next.js provides security features, but you need to configure them correctly. Input validation prevents injection attacks. Security headers protect against various attacks.

Security should be considered from the start, not added as an afterthought. Understanding security best practices helps you build applications that protect user data and prevent attacks. Regular security audits help identify and fix vulnerabilities.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand security best practices for Next.js applications. You'll know how to prevent common vulnerabilities and configure security features. This knowledge enables you to build secure, production-ready applications.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):** A vulnerability where attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages.
*   **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** An attack that tricks users into performing actions they didn't intend.
*   **Input Validation:** Checking and sanitizing user input to prevent attacks.
*   **Security Header:** HTTP headers that provide security features (CSP, HSTS, etc.).
*   **Security Audit:** A systematic review of an application to identify security vulnerabilities.
