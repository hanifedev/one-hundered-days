# Day 71: Advanced Architecture - Micro-Frontends

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Micro-Frontends Concept:** Understand what micro-frontends are and when to use them.
2.  **Architecture Patterns:** Learn different micro-frontend patterns (module federation, iframes, build-time composition).
3.  **Next.js Module Federation:** Explore using module federation with Next.js for micro-frontend architecture.
4.  **Team Independence:** Understand how micro-frontends enable teams to work independently on different parts of an application.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Design a micro-frontend architecture for a large application (even if not fully implemented).

## 📖 Task Explanations

Micro-frontends break large frontend applications into smaller, independently deployable applications. This is valuable for large organizations where different teams work on different parts of an application. Each team can deploy independently, use different technologies, and scale their part of the application.

While micro-frontends add complexity, they provide benefits for large teams and applications. Understanding these patterns helps you work in large organizations and make architectural decisions. Module federation is a modern approach that enables runtime composition of micro-frontends.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand micro-frontend architecture and when to use it. You'll know different patterns and approaches for implementing micro-frontends. This knowledge enables you to work with large-scale applications and make informed architectural decisions.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Micro-Frontend:** An architectural approach where frontend applications are built as a collection of smaller, independent applications.
*   **Module Federation:** A webpack feature that enables runtime sharing of code between applications.
*   **Team Independence:** Allowing different teams to work on different parts of an application independently.
*   **Independent Deployment:** Deploying parts of an application separately without affecting other parts.
*   **Frontend Composition:** Combining multiple frontend applications into a single user experience.
