# Day 51: Real-World Patterns - Monorepo Architecture

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understanding Monorepos:** Learn what monorepos are and when to use them (multiple packages, shared code).
2.  **Monorepo Tools:** Explore monorepo tools (Turborepo, Nx, pnpm workspaces) and their benefits.
3.  **Project Structure:** Learn how to structure a monorepo with multiple Next.js applications and shared packages.
4.  **Shared Code:** Understand how to share code between applications (components, utilities, types, configs).
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Set up a monorepo with multiple Next.js applications and shared packages.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Monorepos allow you to manage multiple related projects in a single repository. This is useful for organizations with multiple applications that share code, or for applications with separate frontend/backend/admin panels. Monorepos improve code sharing, consistency, and developer experience.

Tools like Turborepo provide caching and task orchestration, making monorepos fast and efficient. Understanding monorepo architecture is valuable for working in larger organizations or building complex applications with multiple parts.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand monorepo architecture and how to set up and manage monorepos for Next.js applications. You'll know how to share code between applications and use monorepo tools effectively. This knowledge enables you to work with complex project structures.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Monorepo:** A repository that contains multiple related projects or packages.
*   **Turborepo:** A build system for JavaScript/TypeScript monorepos that provides caching and task orchestration.
*   **Workspace:** A package or project within a monorepo that can depend on other workspaces.
*   **Shared Package:** Code that is shared between multiple applications in a monorepo.
*   **Code Sharing:** Reusing code across multiple projects without duplication.
