# Day 32: Advanced Patterns - API Routes and Server Actions

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **API Routes in App Router:** Learn how to create API routes in the App Router using `route.ts` files.
2.  **Server Actions:** Understand what Server Actions are and how they simplify form handling and data mutations.
3.  **Server Actions Implementation:** Create Server Actions for form submissions and data mutations.
4.  **Progressive Enhancement:** Learn how Server Actions work with JavaScript disabled (progressive enhancement).
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Build forms using Server Actions and compare the developer experience to traditional API routes.

## 📖 Task Explanations

API Routes in App Router work similarly to Pages Router but with some differences. Server Actions are a new feature that simplifies form handling and data mutations. They allow you to call server functions directly from Client Components, reducing boilerplate and improving developer experience.

Server Actions provide progressive enhancement—they work even when JavaScript is disabled, falling back to form submissions. This makes your applications more accessible and resilient. Understanding Server Actions is essential for modern Next.js development.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand API Routes in App Router and Server Actions. You'll know when to use each and how to implement them. This knowledge enables you to build applications with simpler, more maintainable data mutation code.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **API Route:** An endpoint in your Next.js application that handles HTTP requests and returns responses.
*   **Server Action:** A server function that can be called directly from Client Components, simplifying form handling and data mutations.
*   **Progressive Enhancement:** Building applications that work without JavaScript but are enhanced when JavaScript is available.
*   **Data Mutation:** The process of creating, updating, or deleting data (as opposed to reading data).
*   **Form Action:** A Server Action that handles form submissions directly, without needing a separate API route.
