# Day 46: TypeScript - Advanced Types and Patterns

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Advanced TypeScript Types:** Learn advanced TypeScript features (generics, conditional types, mapped types).
2.  **Type Utilities:** Understand TypeScript utility types (`Partial`, `Pick`, `Omit`, `Record`, etc.) and when to use them.
3.  **Type Inference:** Learn how TypeScript infers types and how to leverage inference effectively.
4.  **Type Guards:** Understand how to create and use type guards for runtime type checking.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Refactor an existing project to use advanced TypeScript types and patterns.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Advanced TypeScript features enable you to write more expressive, type-safe code. Generics allow you to create reusable, flexible types. Utility types help you transform existing types without duplicating code. Understanding these features helps you leverage TypeScript's full power.

Type inference reduces boilerplate while maintaining type safety. Type guards allow you to narrow types based on runtime checks, combining static and runtime type safety. These patterns are essential for building robust, type-safe applications.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand advanced TypeScript features and patterns. You'll know how to use generics, utility types, and type guards effectively. This knowledge enables you to write more expressive, type-safe code in Next.js applications.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Generic Type:** A type that works with multiple types, providing flexibility while maintaining type safety.
*   **Utility Type:** A built-in TypeScript type that transforms other types (e.g., `Partial<T>`, `Pick<T, K>`).
*   **Type Inference:** TypeScript's ability to automatically determine types without explicit type annotations.
*   **Type Guard:** A function that narrows a type based on a runtime check.
*   **Conditional Type:** A type that selects one of two types based on a condition.
