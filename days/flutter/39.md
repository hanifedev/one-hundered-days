# Day 39: Navigation - Advanced Navigation Patterns

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Replace Instead of Push:** Learn when and how to use `Navigator.pushReplacement()` to replace the current screen instead of adding to the stack.
2.  **Clear Navigation Stack:** Use `Navigator.pushAndRemoveUntil()` to navigate to a new screen and clear the navigation history.
3.  **Initial Route:** Set a custom initial route using `MaterialApp`'s `initialRoute` parameter.
4.  **Navigation Guards:** Implement basic navigation guards (e.g., preventing navigation if a form is incomplete).
5.  **Practice Project:** Build a simple authentication flow where users can log in, and successful login replaces the login screen with a home screen.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn advanced navigation patterns that are essential for building professional applications. Sometimes, you don't want to add a new screen to the stack—you want to replace the current one or clear the entire stack. This is common in scenarios like authentication flows, where you don't want users to be able to go back to the login screen after logging in.

`Navigator.pushReplacement()` replaces the current route with a new one, which is useful when you want to prevent users from going back (e.g., after completing a critical action). `Navigator.pushAndRemoveUntil()` is even more powerful—it navigates to a new screen and removes all previous screens from the stack until a certain condition is met.

Navigation guards allow you to control when navigation can occur. For example, you might want to prevent users from leaving a form screen if they have unsaved changes. This adds a layer of control and user experience polish to your app.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand advanced navigation patterns and when to use them. You'll be able to control the navigation stack more precisely, implement authentication flows, and add navigation guards. These skills are essential for building production-ready Flutter applications.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **`Navigator.pushReplacement()`:** A method that replaces the current route with a new route, removing the current route from the stack.
*   **`Navigator.pushAndRemoveUntil()`:** A method that pushes a new route and removes all previous routes until a condition is met.
*   **Navigation Guard:** A mechanism that controls whether navigation should be allowed based on certain conditions (e.g., form validation, authentication status).
*   **Initial Route:** The first screen displayed when the app starts, defined using `MaterialApp.initialRoute`.
