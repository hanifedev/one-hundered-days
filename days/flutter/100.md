# Day 100: CI/CD - Advanced Workflows and Final Project

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Advanced Workflows:** Learn about advanced CI/CD features (matrix builds, conditional steps, artifacts).
2.  **Set Up Multi-Platform Builds:** Configure workflows to build for both Android and iOS (if possible) or multiple Android variants.
3.  **Automate Testing:** Ensure your CI/CD pipeline runs all tests (unit tests, widget tests) automatically.
4.  **Final Project Review:** Review one of your previous projects, optimize it, add tests, and set up CI/CD.
5.  **Reflection:** Reflect on your 100-day Flutter journey, what you've learned, and next steps.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today marks the completion of your 100-day Flutter journey! You'll learn advanced CI/CD features and then apply everything you've learned to a final project.

Advanced CI/CD features include:
- **Matrix Builds:** Building for multiple platforms or configurations simultaneously
- **Conditional Steps:** Running steps only under certain conditions
- **Artifacts:** Saving build outputs (APKs, IPAs) for download
- **Notifications:** Sending notifications when builds fail or succeed

You'll set up a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline that:
- Runs on multiple platforms (if possible)
- Runs all your tests automatically
- Builds release versions
- Saves build artifacts

For your final project, choose one of your previous projects and:
- Review and optimize the code
- Add comprehensive tests
- Set up CI/CD
- Ensure it follows best practices

Finally, take time to reflect on your journey. You've learned a tremendous amount—from Dart fundamentals to advanced topics like BLoC, testing, performance, and CI/CD. Consider what you want to learn next and how you'll continue growing as a Flutter developer.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have completed your 100-day Flutter journey! You'll understand advanced CI/CD workflows and have applied everything you've learned to a final, production-ready project. You'll have the skills and knowledge to build professional Flutter applications and continue your growth as a developer.
