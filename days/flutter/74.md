# Day 74: Widget Testing - Verifying Widget Properties

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Verify Text Content:** Use `expect()` with finders to verify that widgets display the correct text.
2.  **Verify Widget Presence:** Check that widgets exist or don't exist using `expect(find.byType(...), findsOneWidget)`.
3.  **Verify Widget Count:** Use `findsWidgets`, `findsOneWidget`, `findsNothing` to verify how many widgets match a finder.
4.  **Verify Widget Properties:** Access widget properties using `tester.widget()` and verify their values.
5.  **Test Conditional Rendering:** Write tests that verify widgets appear or disappear based on state changes.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn how to verify that widgets have the correct properties and behavior. Testing isn't just about finding widgets—it's about ensuring they're correct.

You'll use `expect()` with finders to make assertions:
- **`findsOneWidget`:** Verifies exactly one widget matches
- **`findsWidgets`:** Verifies one or more widgets match
- **`findsNothing`:** Verifies no widgets match
- **`findsNWidgets(n)`:** Verifies exactly n widgets match

You can also access widget properties directly using `tester.widget()`, which gives you the actual widget instance. This allows you to verify properties like colors, sizes, enabled/disabled states, etc.

Testing conditional rendering is important—you want to ensure that widgets appear or disappear based on state. For example, a loading indicator should appear when data is loading and disappear when data arrives. These tests ensure your UI correctly reflects the application state.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to verify widget properties and behavior in your tests. You'll understand how to check text content, widget presence, widget counts, and conditional rendering. This ensures that your widgets not only exist but also have the correct properties and behavior.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Assertion:** A statement that verifies a condition is true (e.g., `expect(finder, findsOneWidget)`).
*   **`findsOneWidget`:** A matcher that verifies exactly one widget matches a finder.
*   **`findsWidgets`:** A matcher that verifies one or more widgets match a finder.
*   **`findsNothing`:** A matcher that verifies no widgets match a finder.
*   **Conditional Rendering:** The practice of showing or hiding widgets based on application state or conditions.
