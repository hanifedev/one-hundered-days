# Day 38: Navigation - Named Routes

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Named Routes:** Learn what named routes are and why they're useful compared to direct navigation.
2.  **Define Routes:** Use `MaterialApp`'s `routes` parameter to define named routes for your app.
3.  **Navigate with Names:** Use `Navigator.pushNamed()` instead of `Navigator.push()` to navigate using route names.
4.  **Pass Arguments with Named Routes:** Learn how to pass arguments when using named routes (using `arguments` parameter or `ModalRoute.of(context)`).
5.  **Practice Project:** Refactor your previous navigation examples to use named routes instead of direct navigation.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn about named routes, which provide a more organized and maintainable way to handle navigation in Flutter. Instead of directly creating screen instances in `Navigator.push()`, you define routes with names (like '/home', '/details') and navigate using those names.

Named routes have several advantages: they centralize your navigation logic, make it easier to change which screen a route points to, and make your code more readable. They're especially useful in larger applications where you might have many screens.

Passing arguments with named routes requires a slightly different approach than with direct navigation. You can pass arguments using the `arguments` parameter in `Navigator.pushNamed()`, and then retrieve them in the destination screen using `ModalRoute.of(context)?.settings.arguments`.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand how to use named routes for navigation. You'll be able to organize your app's navigation in a more maintainable way and pass data using named routes. This is a more professional approach to navigation that scales better as your app grows.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Named Route:** A route identified by a string name (e.g., '/home', '/details') rather than by directly referencing a widget class.
*   **Route Table:** A map that associates route names with the widgets (screens) they should display, typically defined in `MaterialApp.routes`.
*   **`Navigator.pushNamed()`:** A method that navigates to a screen using its route name instead of directly creating the screen widget.
*   **`ModalRoute.of(context)`:** A method that retrieves the current route, useful for accessing arguments passed to named routes.
