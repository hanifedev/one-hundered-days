# Day 83: Animations - Hero Animations

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Hero Animations:** Learn what Hero animations are and why they're useful (smooth transitions between screens).
2.  **Use Hero Widget:** Wrap widgets with `Hero` widget and provide a unique `tag` to enable Hero animations.
3.  **Create Shared Element Transitions:** Implement Hero animations between screens (e.g., an image that expands from a list to a detail screen).
4.  **Customize Hero Animation:** Use `HeroController` or custom routes to customize Hero animation behavior.
5.  **Practice Project:** Build a simple app with Hero animations (e.g., a photo gallery where tapping an image expands it with a Hero animation).

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn about Hero animations, which are one of Flutter's most impressive animation features. Hero animations create smooth transitions where a widget appears to "fly" from one screen to another, creating a sense of continuity and polish.

Hero animations work by matching widgets with the same `tag` across different screens. When you navigate from one screen to another, Flutter automatically animates the transition between the two Hero widgets, creating a seamless visual connection.

Common use cases include:
- Images that expand from a list to a detail view
- Avatars that expand to show profile details
- Cards that expand to show full content

You'll wrap the widget you want to animate with a `Hero` widget and provide a unique tag. The same tag must be used on both screens. Flutter handles the rest automatically, creating a smooth transition.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand Hero animations and how to implement them. You'll be able to create smooth, polished transitions between screens that make your app feel more cohesive and professional. Hero animations are a signature Flutter feature that users notice and appreciate.
