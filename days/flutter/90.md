# Day 90: Advanced Navigation - Practice Project & Review

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Project Goal:** Build a complete app with advanced navigation features (e.g., a social app, an e-commerce app, or a news reader).
2.  **Implement GoRouter:** Set up `go_router` with all your app's routes and proper route configuration.
3.  **Add Deep Linking:** Ensure all important screens can be accessed via deep links with proper parameters.
4.  **Implement Nested Navigation:** Create nested navigation if your app requires it (e.g., bottom navigation with tabs).
5.  **Add Route Guards:** Implement authentication guards or other route protection as needed.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll apply everything you've learned about advanced navigation by building a complete application. This project will help you understand how to structure navigation in a real-world app.

Plan your navigation structure carefully:
- Identify all screens and their relationships
- Define routes with appropriate paths and parameters
- Consider which screens need deep linking
- Plan nested navigation if needed (tabs, drawers, etc.)

Set up `go_router` with all your routes. Make sure important screens support deep linking so users can share links and your app works well on web. If your app has authentication, implement route guards to protect sensitive screens.

Test your navigation thoroughly:
- Test all routes and navigation flows
- Test deep links on different platforms
- Test route guards and redirects
- Test back navigation and edge cases

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have built a complete application with advanced navigation. You'll have practical experience in using `go_router`, implementing deep linking, nested navigation, and route guards. This project demonstrates your ability to build production-ready apps with sophisticated, professional navigation.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Navigation Architecture:** The overall design and structure of navigation in an application, including routes, guards, and nested navigation.
*   **Production-Ready Navigation:** Navigation that supports deep linking, handles edge cases, and provides a smooth user experience across platforms.
*   **Route Protection:** The practice of protecting routes with guards to ensure only authorized users can access certain screens.
*   **Cross-Platform Navigation:** Navigation that works consistently across Android, iOS, and Web platforms.
*   **Professional Navigation:** Navigation that follows best practices, supports all required features, and provides excellent UX.
