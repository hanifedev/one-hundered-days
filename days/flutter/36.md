# Day 36: Navigation - Introduction to Navigator

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Navigation Concepts:** Learn what navigation means in mobile apps and why it's important.
2.  **Explore Navigator Widget:** Understand the `Navigator` widget and how it manages a stack of routes.
3.  **Basic Navigation:** Use `Navigator.push()` to navigate to a new screen and `Navigator.pop()` to go back.
4.  **Create Multiple Screens:** Build a simple app with at least two screens (e.g., a home screen and a details screen).
5.  **Practice Navigation Flow:** Navigate between screens using buttons and understand the navigation stack.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn one of the most important concepts in mobile app development: navigation. Navigation is how users move between different screens in your app. In Flutter, navigation is managed by the `Navigator` widget, which maintains a stack of routes (screens).

Think of the navigation stack like a stack of plates. When you navigate to a new screen, you "push" it onto the stack. When you go back, you "pop" the top screen off the stack. This is why `Navigator.push()` takes you forward and `Navigator.pop()` takes you back.

You'll start with the simplest form of navigation: pushing a new screen onto the stack. This is the foundation for all navigation in Flutter, and understanding it is crucial before moving on to more advanced navigation patterns.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand the fundamentals of navigation in Flutter. You'll be able to create multi-screen applications and navigate between them. This is a critical skill, as most real-world applications have multiple screens. You'll have a solid foundation for learning more advanced navigation techniques in the coming days.
