# Day 99: CI/CD - Introduction and GitHub Actions

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand CI/CD:** Learn what CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) is and why it's important.
2.  **Explore CI/CD Benefits:** Understand the benefits (automated testing, builds, deployments, consistency).
3.  **Set Up GitHub Actions:** Create a GitHub Actions workflow file (`.github/workflows/`) for your Flutter project.
4.  **Configure Build Workflow:** Set up a workflow that builds your Flutter app on every push or pull request.
5.  **Test the Workflow:** Push code to GitHub and verify that the CI/CD pipeline runs successfully.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll be introduced to CI/CD, which is essential for professional development workflows. CI/CD automates testing, building, and deploying your app, ensuring consistency and catching issues early.

**Continuous Integration (CI):** Automatically builds and tests your code whenever you push changes. This catches bugs early and ensures code quality.

**Continuous Deployment (CD):** Automatically deploys your app when changes pass all tests. This speeds up releases and reduces manual errors.

GitHub Actions is a popular CI/CD platform that's free for public repositories. You'll create a workflow file (YAML format) that defines:
- When to run (on push, pull request, etc.)
- What to do (install dependencies, run tests, build app)
- Where to deploy (if applicable)

You'll set up a basic workflow that:
- Checks out your code
- Sets up Flutter
- Installs dependencies
- Runs tests
- Builds your app

This ensures your app builds successfully and tests pass on every change.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand CI/CD and how to set up a basic GitHub Actions workflow for your Flutter project. You'll be able to automate builds and tests, ensuring code quality and consistency. This knowledge is essential for professional development workflows.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment):** Automated processes that build, test, and deploy applications.
*   **GitHub Actions:** A CI/CD platform integrated with GitHub that automates workflows.
*   **Workflow:** An automated process defined in a YAML file that runs on specific events (push, PR, etc.).
