4.  **Access Theme in Widgets:** Use `Theme.of(context)` to access theme properties in your widgets.
5.  **Customize Theme:** Customize colors, text styles, and component themes to match your app's design.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn about theming, which is essential for creating consistent, professional-looking applications. A theme defines the visual style of your app: colors, text styles, button styles, and more.

`ThemeData` is Flutter's theming system. It provides a comprehensive set of properties that control the appearance of Material Design components. Instead of hardcoding colors and styles throughout your app, you define them once in a theme and use them consistently.

You'll set a global theme using `MaterialApp`'s `theme` parameter. This theme will be used by all Material widgets in your app automatically. You can access theme properties in your widgets using `Theme.of(context)`, which allows you to use theme colors and styles in custom widgets.

Customizing your theme involves setting properties like:
- `colorScheme`: Primary, secondary, error colors, etc.
- `textTheme`: Text styles for different text types
- `buttonTheme`, `cardTheme`, etc.: Styles for specific components

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand theming and how to create and use a global theme in your Flutter app. You'll be able to customize colors, text styles, and component themes, creating a consistent visual design throughout your application.
