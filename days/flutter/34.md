# Day 34: State Management - Building a To-Do App (Part 3)

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Add Edit Functionality:** Allow users to edit existing todos (e.g., long-press to edit or tap an edit icon).
2.  **Implement Filtering:** Add the ability to filter todos by status (e.g., show all, show only completed, show only active).
3.  **Add Persistence (Optional):** Use `shared_preferences` package to save todos locally so they persist after the app is closed.
4.  **Error Handling:** Add basic error handling for edge cases (e.g., empty todo titles, invalid operations).
5.  **Code Organization:** Refactor your code by extracting reusable widgets and organizing your code into separate files.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll add advanced features to your To-Do app and improve its robustness. Editing functionality will require you to manage an "editing mode" state, where a todo can be modified. This is a great exercise in managing more complex state scenarios.

Filtering is another important feature that will help you understand how to derive UI from state. You'll maintain a filter state (e.g., "all", "completed", "active") and use it to filter the list of todos before displaying them.

If you choose to add persistence, you'll get your first taste of working with external packages in Flutter. The `shared_preferences` package allows you to store simple data locally on the device, which means your todos will survive app restarts.

Finally, as your app grows, code organization becomes crucial. Extracting widgets into separate files and organizing your code logically will make it more maintainable and easier to understand.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have a feature-rich To-Do application that demonstrates your ability to manage complex state, handle user interactions, and organize code effectively. You'll have practical experience with filtering, editing, and potentially local data persistence. This project will serve as a strong portfolio piece.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **State Derivation:** The process of computing UI or data from existing state (e.g., filtering a list based on a filter state).
*   **Persistence:** The ability to save data so it remains available after the application is closed and reopened.
*   **`shared_preferences`:** A Flutter package for storing simple key-value pairs locally on the device.
*   **Code Refactoring:** The process of restructuring existing code without changing its functionality to improve readability and maintainability.
