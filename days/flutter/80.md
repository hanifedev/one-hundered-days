# Day 80: Responsive UI & Theming - Practice Project & Review

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Project Goal:** Build a complete app with responsive design and theming (e.g., a news reader, a product catalog, or a social feed).
2.  **Implement Responsive Layout:** Use `MediaQuery` and `LayoutBuilder` to create layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.
3.  **Create Custom Theme:** Design and implement a custom theme with your own color scheme and text styles.
4.  **Implement Dark Mode:** Add dark mode support with a theme toggle and preference persistence.
5.  **Test on Different Devices:** Test your app on different screen sizes (phone, tablet) and in both light and dark modes.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll apply everything you've learned about responsive design and theming by building a complete application. This project will help you understand how to combine these concepts to create a professional, adaptable app.

Start by planning your responsive layout. Identify breakpoints where your layout should change (e.g., single column on phones, multi-column on tablets). Use `MediaQuery` for device-level information and `LayoutBuilder` for widget-level constraints.

Create a custom theme that matches your app's design. Choose a color scheme, define text styles, and customize component themes. Make sure your theme works well in both light and dark modes.

Implement dark mode with a toggle that allows users to switch themes. Save their preference so it persists. Test your app thoroughly on different screen sizes and in both themes to ensure everything looks and works correctly.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have built a complete application with responsive design and theming. You'll have practical experience in creating adaptive layouts, custom themes, and dark mode support. This project demonstrates your ability to build professional, user-friendly apps that work well on all devices and in all lighting conditions.
