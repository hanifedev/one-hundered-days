# Day 49: API Integration - Using json_serializable (Optional Advanced)

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Code Generation:** Learn about code generation as an alternative to manual JSON serialization.
2.  **Install Packages:** Add `json_annotation`, `json_serializable`, and `build_runner` to your project.
3.  **Annotate Model Classes:** Use `@JsonSerializable()` annotation and `@JsonKey()` for custom field mappings.
4.  **Generate Code:** Run `build_runner` to automatically generate `fromJson` and `toJson` methods.
5.  **Compare Approaches:** Understand when to use manual serialization vs. code generation.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn about an advanced approach to JSON serialization using code generation. While manual serialization works well for simple cases, code generation can save time and reduce errors for complex models or large projects.

The `json_serializable` package uses annotations to mark your model classes, then generates the serialization code automatically. This means you write less boilerplate code and the generated code is consistent and less error-prone.

However, code generation adds complexity to your build process and requires running `build_runner` whenever you change your models. It's important to understand both approaches so you can choose the right one for your project.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand code generation as an approach to JSON serialization. You'll know how to use `json_serializable` to automatically generate serialization code, and you'll be able to decide when this approach is appropriate versus manual serialization. This gives you flexibility in choosing the right tool for each project.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Code Generation:** The process of automatically generating code from annotations or configuration, reducing boilerplate and potential errors.
*   **Annotation:** Metadata added to code (using `@`) that provides information to tools or frameworks (e.g., `@JsonSerializable()`).
*   **`json_serializable`:** A Flutter package that generates JSON serialization code from annotations.
*   **`build_runner`:** A Dart tool that runs code generators to produce generated files.
*   **Boilerplate Code:** Repetitive code that follows a predictable pattern and can often be automated.
