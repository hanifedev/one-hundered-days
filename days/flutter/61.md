# Day 61: BLoC Pattern - Introduction and Core Concepts

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand BLoC Pattern:** Learn what BLoC (Business Logic Component) is and why it's a popular state management solution.
2.  **Learn Core Concepts:** Understand the three core concepts: Events (user actions), States (UI representation), and BLoC (business logic handler).
3.  **Install flutter_bloc Package:** Add the `flutter_bloc` package to your project.
4.  **Understand Streams:** Review Streams (from Day 11-15) as BLoC uses Streams to emit states.
5.  **Create Your First BLoC:** Build a simple counter BLoC to understand the basic structure (Event → BLoC → State).

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll be introduced to the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern, which is one of the most popular and powerful state management solutions in Flutter. BLoC separates business logic completely from the UI, making your code more testable, maintainable, and scalable.

The BLoC pattern is based on three core concepts:
- **Events:** User actions or system events that trigger state changes (e.g., button pressed, data loaded)
- **States:** Representations of your app's state at a given moment (e.g., loading, success, error)
- **BLoC:** The component that receives events, processes business logic, and emits new states

BLoC uses Streams to emit states, so understanding Streams (which you learned earlier) is important. The flow is: Event comes in → BLoC processes it → New State is emitted → UI rebuilds.

You'll start with a simple counter example to see how this pattern works in practice. This will help you understand the fundamental structure before moving to more complex scenarios.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand the BLoC pattern and its core concepts. You'll be able to create a basic BLoC and understand how events flow through the BLoC to produce states. This foundation is essential for building complex applications with clean architecture.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **BLoC (Business Logic Component):** A state management pattern that separates business logic from UI by using Events and States with Streams.
*   **Event:** An action or occurrence that triggers a state change in a BLoC (e.g., user button press, API call completion).
*   **State:** A representation of the application's condition at a specific point in time, emitted by a BLoC.
*   **Stream:** A sequence of asynchronous events that can be listened to, used by BLoC to emit states.
*   **`flutter_bloc` Package:** A Flutter package that provides tools and widgets for implementing the BLoC pattern.
