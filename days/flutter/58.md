# Day 58: Local Data Storage - CRUD Operations (Part 2)

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Implement Update:** Write functions to update existing records in your database.
2.  **Implement Delete:** Write functions to delete records from your database (delete by ID, delete all, conditional delete).
3.  **Handle Errors:** Add proper error handling for all database operations (e.g., record not found, database errors).
4.  **Integrate with UI:** Connect your database operations to your app's UI, ensuring the UI updates when data changes.
5.  **Practice:** Complete your app from Day 57 by adding update and delete functionality.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll complete your CRUD operations by implementing Update and Delete. Updating involves modifying existing records in your database, while deleting involves removing records. You'll learn different deletion strategies: deleting a specific record, deleting all records, or deleting records that match certain conditions.

Error handling is crucial for database operations. What happens if you try to update a record that doesn't exist? What if the database is locked? You'll learn how to handle these scenarios gracefully and provide feedback to users.

Finally, you'll integrate your database operations with your UI. This means when a user adds, updates, or deletes data, the UI should reflect those changes immediately. You might use Provider to manage the database state and automatically update the UI when data changes.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have complete CRUD functionality working with your local database. You'll be able to create, read, update, and delete data, handle errors properly, and integrate database operations with your UI. This gives you the full toolkit for working with local data storage.
