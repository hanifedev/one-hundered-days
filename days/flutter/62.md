# Day 62: BLoC Pattern - Implementing BLoC with flutter_bloc

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Create Event Classes:** Define event classes that extend `Equatable` (for value comparison) to represent user actions.
2.  **Create State Classes:** Define state classes that extend `Equatable` to represent different UI states.
3.  **Implement BLoC Class:** Create a BLoC class that extends `Bloc<Event, State>` and handles event-to-state transformations.
4.  **Use BlocBuilder:** Learn how to use `BlocBuilder` widget to rebuild UI when state changes.
5.  **Use BlocProvider:** Wrap your app or specific widgets with `BlocProvider` to provide BLoC instances.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn how to implement the BLoC pattern using the `flutter_bloc` package. You'll create the three main components: Events, States, and the BLoC itself.

Event classes represent the different actions that can occur in your app. They should extend `Equatable` so that BLoC can properly compare events. State classes represent the different states your UI can be in. They also extend `Equatable` for proper comparison.

The BLoC class extends `Bloc<Event, State>` and contains the business logic. In the constructor, you register event handlers using `on<EventType>()` that specify how each event should be transformed into a new state.

In your UI, you'll use `BlocProvider` to provide the BLoC instance to the widget tree, and `BlocBuilder` to listen to state changes and rebuild the UI accordingly. This creates a reactive architecture where the UI automatically updates when the state changes.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to implement a complete BLoC pattern with events, states, and the BLoC handler. You'll understand how to connect BLoC to your UI using `BlocProvider` and `BlocBuilder`. This knowledge enables you to build applications with clean separation between business logic and UI.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **`Equatable`:** A package that provides value equality comparison, useful for Events and States to prevent unnecessary rebuilds.
*   **`Bloc<Event, State>`:** The base class for creating BLoC instances, specifying the event and state types.
*   **`BlocProvider`:** A widget that provides a BLoC instance to its descendants in the widget tree.
*   **`BlocBuilder`:** A widget that rebuilds its child when the BLoC's state changes, listening to state updates.
*   **Event Handler:** A function registered in a BLoC that specifies how to transform a specific event into a new state.
