# Day 44: API Integration - Error Handling

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Error Scenarios:** Learn about common error scenarios when making HTTP requests (network errors, server errors, timeouts).
2.  **Use Try-Catch Blocks:** Implement `try-catch` blocks to handle exceptions that may occur during HTTP requests.
3.  **Handle Different Error Types:** Distinguish between different types of errors (network failures, HTTP errors, parsing errors).
4.  **Provide User Feedback:** Display appropriate error messages to users when requests fail (e.g., "No internet connection", "Server error").
5.  **Implement Retry Logic (Optional):** Add basic retry logic for failed requests (e.g., retry once if a request fails).

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn one of the most important aspects of API integration: error handling. In the real world, things go wrong—networks fail, servers are down, or requests timeout. Your app needs to handle these situations gracefully.

You'll use `try-catch` blocks to catch exceptions that may occur during HTTP requests. The `http` package can throw exceptions for various reasons: network failures, timeouts, or invalid responses. You need to catch these and handle them appropriately.

Different errors require different handling. A network error might mean the user has no internet connection, while a 404 error means the resource wasn't found. A 500 error indicates a server problem. Providing clear, user-friendly error messages is crucial for a good user experience.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to handle errors gracefully in your API integration. You'll understand how to catch and handle different types of errors, provide feedback to users, and make your app more robust. This is essential for building production-ready applications that work reliably even when things go wrong.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Error Handling:** The process of anticipating, detecting, and responding to errors that may occur during program execution.
*   **Try-Catch Block:** A programming construct that allows you to attempt code execution and handle any exceptions that occur.
*   **Exception:** An error or unexpected condition that occurs during program execution and interrupts normal flow.
*   **Network Error:** An error that occurs when a network request fails due to connectivity issues, timeouts, or network unavailability.
*   **HTTP Error:** An error indicated by an HTTP status code outside the 200-299 range (e.g., 404, 500).
