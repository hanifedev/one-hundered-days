# Day 87: Advanced Navigation - Using GoRouter

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Install go_router:** Add the `go_router` package to your project.
2.  **Set Up GoRouter:** Create a `GoRouter` instance with route configuration.
3.  **Define Routes:** Define your app's routes using `GoRoute` with paths and page builders.
4.  **Navigate with GoRouter:** Use `context.go()`, `context.push()`, and `context.pop()` for navigation.
5.  **Practice Project:** Refactor a previous app to use `go_router` instead of Navigator 1.0.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn how to use `go_router`, which is the most popular package for implementing Navigator 2.0-style navigation. It provides a simpler API while giving you the benefits of Navigator 2.0.

Setting up `go_router` involves creating a `GoRouter` instance with your route configuration. You define routes using `GoRoute`, specifying:
- **Path:** The URL path (e.g., '/home', '/details/:id')
- **Page Builder:** A function that builds the widget for that route
- **Optional parameters:** Redirects, sub-routes, etc.

Navigation with `go_router` is straightforward:
- **`context.go('/path')`:** Navigate to a route (replaces current route)
- **`context.push('/path')`:** Push a new route onto the stack
- **`context.pop()`:** Pop the current route

`go_router` handles URL generation automatically, so your app's navigation state is reflected in the URL (great for web and deep linking).

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to use `go_router` for navigation in your Flutter apps. You'll understand how to set up routes, navigate between screens, and benefit from declarative navigation. This knowledge enables you to build apps with better navigation, especially for web and deep linking scenarios.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **`GoRouter`:** A package that simplifies Navigator 2.0 implementation with an intuitive API.
*   **Route Configuration:** The definition of all routes in your app, including paths and page builders.
*   **`GoRoute`:** A class that defines a single route with its path and page builder.
*   **`context.go()`:** A method that navigates to a route, replacing the current route in the stack.
*   **`context.push()`:** A method that pushes a new route onto the navigation stack.
