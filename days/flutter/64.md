# Day 64: BLoC Pattern - Advanced Features

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **BlocListener:** Learn how to use `BlocListener` to perform side effects (navigation, showing dialogs) when state changes.
2.  **BlocConsumer:** Understand `BlocConsumer`, which combines `BlocBuilder` and `BlocListener` for convenience.
3.  **BlocObserver:** Create a custom `BlocObserver` to log all BLoC events and state changes for debugging.
4.  **MultiBlocProvider:** Use `MultiBlocProvider` when you need multiple BLoCs/Cubits in your widget tree.
5.  **Error Handling:** Implement proper error states in your BLoC/Cubit and handle errors gracefully in the UI.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn about advanced features of the BLoC pattern that make it more powerful and easier to work with. These features help you handle side effects, debug your app, and manage multiple BLoCs.

`BlocListener` is used for side effects—actions that should happen once when a state changes (like navigating to a new screen or showing a snackbar). Unlike `BlocBuilder`, which rebuilds the UI, `BlocListener` doesn't rebuild but allows you to react to state changes.

`BlocConsumer` combines both `BlocBuilder` and `BlocListener`, so you can rebuild the UI and perform side effects in one widget. This is convenient when you need both behaviors.

`BlocObserver` is a powerful debugging tool. You can create a custom observer that logs all events and state changes, making it easier to understand what's happening in your app during development.

You'll also learn how to handle errors properly by creating error states and displaying appropriate error messages to users.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand advanced BLoC features and how to use them effectively. You'll be able to handle side effects, debug your BLoCs, manage multiple BLoCs, and handle errors properly. This knowledge enables you to build robust, production-ready applications with BLoC.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Side Effect:** An action that occurs as a result of a state change but doesn't directly affect the UI rebuild (e.g., navigation, showing a dialog).
*   **`BlocListener`:** A widget that listens to state changes and performs side effects, but doesn't rebuild the UI.
*   **`BlocConsumer`:** A widget that combines `BlocBuilder` and `BlocListener`, allowing both UI rebuilding and side effects.
*   **`BlocObserver`:** A class that can observe all BLoC events and state changes, useful for logging and debugging.
*   **Error State:** A specific state that represents an error condition, allowing the UI to display appropriate error messages.
