# Day 92: Platform Channels - Implementing Method Channels (Android)

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Set Up Android Project:** Understand the Android project structure in a Flutter app.
2.  **Create Method Channel:** Set up a `MethodChannel` in your Dart code.
3.  **Implement Android Handler:** Write Kotlin/Java code in Android to handle method calls from Dart.
4.  **Call Native Methods:** Call native Android methods from Dart and receive results.
5.  **Handle Errors:** Implement proper error handling for platform channel calls.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn how to implement platform channels for Android. You'll write both Dart code (to call the channel) and Kotlin/Java code (to handle the calls).

In your Dart code, you'll create a `MethodChannel` with a unique name. This channel is used to communicate with native code. You'll call `invokeMethod()` to call a method in native code and receive the result.

In your Android code (Kotlin or Java), you'll set up a `MethodCallHandler` that receives calls from Dart. You'll check which method was called and execute the appropriate native code. You can return results, throw exceptions, or use `notImplemented()` if a method isn't supported.

Common Android operations you might implement:
- Getting device information
- Accessing system services
- Using Android-specific APIs
- Integrating with Android libraries

You'll also learn to handle errors properly, as platform channel calls can fail for various reasons (method not found, native code errors, etc.).

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to implement method channels for Android. You'll understand how to set up communication between Dart and Android native code, call native methods, and handle results and errors. This knowledge enables you to access Android-specific features when needed.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Method Channel (Android):** A platform channel implementation for Android that allows Dart to call Kotlin/Java methods.
*   **`MethodCallHandler`:** An interface in Android that handles method calls from Flutter.
*   **`invokeMethod()`:** A Dart method that calls a method in native code via a method channel.
*   **Android Project Structure:** The organization of Android-specific code in a Flutter project (typically in `android/app/src/main/`).
*   **Native Android Code:** Code written in Kotlin or Java that runs on the Android platform.
