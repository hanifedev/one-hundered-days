# Day 94: Platform Channels - Event Channels and Streams

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Event Channels:** Learn what event channels are and when to use them (continuous data streams from native code).
2.  **Compare Method vs Event Channels:** Understand when to use method channels (one-time calls) vs event channels (continuous streams).
3.  **Implement Event Channel:** Set up an `EventChannel` in Dart to receive stream data from native code.
4.  **Handle Stream Events:** Listen to events from native code and handle them in Dart using Streams.
5.  **Practice Project:** Build a simple example that uses event channels (e.g., listening to battery level changes, sensor data).

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn about event channels, which are used when you need continuous data from native code (as opposed to one-time method calls). Event channels create a stream of data that flows from native code to Dart.

Use event channels when:
- You need continuous updates (e.g., battery level, sensor readings, location updates)
- Native code needs to push data to Dart over time
- You're listening to platform events (e.g., network changes, location updates)

The flow works like this:
1. Dart sets up an `EventChannel` and listens to the stream
2. Native code starts sending events
3. Events flow through the channel to Dart
4. Dart handles events in the stream

This is different from method channels, which are for one-time calls and responses. Event channels are for ongoing communication.

You'll implement a simple example, such as listening to battery level changes or sensor data, to understand how event channels work in practice.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand event channels and when to use them. You'll be able to set up streams that receive continuous data from native code and handle events in Dart. This knowledge enables you to work with platform features that provide continuous data streams.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Event Channel:** A platform channel that provides a continuous stream of data from native code to Dart.
*   **Stream:** A sequence of asynchronous events that can be listened to, used by event channels to send data.
*   **Continuous Data:** Data that updates over time (e.g., sensor readings, location updates, battery level).
*   **Platform Events:** Events that originate from the platform (Android/iOS) and need to be communicated to Flutter.
*   **One-Way Communication:** Data flow from native code to Dart (as opposed to method channels which are two-way).
