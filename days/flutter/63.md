# Day 63: BLoC Pattern - Cubit (Simplified BLoC)

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Cubit:** Learn what Cubit is and how it differs from BLoC (simpler, no events, direct method calls).
2.  **When to Use Cubit:** Understand when to use Cubit vs. full BLoC (Cubit for simpler cases, BLoC for complex event handling).
3.  **Create a Cubit:** Implement a `Cubit` class that extends `Cubit<State>` and emits states directly via methods.
4.  **Use Cubit in UI:** Use `CubitProvider` and `BlocBuilder` (works with both BLoC and Cubit) to connect Cubit to your UI.
5.  **Practice Project:** Refactor a simple feature from your previous apps to use Cubit instead of Provider or setState.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn about Cubit, which is a simplified version of BLoC. While BLoC uses Events and States, Cubit eliminates the Event layer and allows you to call methods directly on the Cubit to emit new states.

Cubit is perfect for simpler use cases where you don't need the complexity of events. Instead of dispatching events and handling them, you simply call methods on the Cubit (e.g., `cubit.increment()`, `cubit.loadData()`), and the Cubit emits new states directly.

The choice between Cubit and BLoC depends on your needs:
- **Cubit:** Simpler, less boilerplate, good for straightforward state management
- **BLoC:** More structured, better for complex event handling, better for tracking all user actions

You'll use the same widgets (`CubitProvider` instead of `BlocProvider`, but `BlocBuilder` works for both) to connect Cubit to your UI. The API is very similar, making it easy to switch between them.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand Cubit and when to use it versus full BLoC. You'll be able to implement Cubit for simpler state management scenarios and know how to choose the right tool for each situation. This gives you flexibility in your state management approach.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Cubit:** A simplified version of BLoC that eliminates the Event layer, allowing direct method calls to emit states.
*   **`Cubit<State>`:** The base class for creating Cubit instances, specifying only the state type (no events).
*   **`CubitProvider`:** A widget that provides a Cubit instance to its descendants, similar to `BlocProvider`.
*   **Method Call:** Direct invocation of a function on a Cubit instance to trigger state changes, as opposed to dispatching events in BLoC.
*   **Boilerplate:** Repetitive code that follows a predictable pattern, often reduced by using simpler patterns like Cubit.
