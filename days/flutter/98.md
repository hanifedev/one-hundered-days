# Day 98: Performance - Build Size and App Optimization

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Build Sizes:** Learn why app size matters (download time, storage, user experience).
2.  **Analyze App Size:** Use tools to analyze your app's build size and identify what's taking up space.
3.  **Optimize Assets:** Learn techniques to optimize images, fonts, and other assets (compression, using appropriate formats).
4.  **Remove Unused Code:** Learn about tree-shaking and how to remove unused code and dependencies.
5.  **Build Release Version:** Build a release version of your app and compare its size to debug builds.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn about optimizing your app's build size. Smaller apps download faster, use less storage, and provide a better user experience. App size optimization is important for user acquisition and retention.

You'll learn to analyze your app's size:
- Check the size of your APK/IPA files
- Identify which assets and dependencies are taking up space
- Use tools to see what's included in your build

Optimization techniques include:
- **Asset Optimization:** Compress images, use appropriate formats (WebP for images), remove unused assets
- **Code Optimization:** Remove unused dependencies, enable tree-shaking, use code splitting
- **Build Configuration:** Use release builds (which are optimized and smaller than debug builds)

You'll build a release version of your app, which is automatically optimized by Flutter (smaller, faster, no debug symbols). Compare this to debug builds to see the difference.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand how to optimize your app's build size. You'll be able to analyze app size, optimize assets, remove unused code, and build optimized release versions. This knowledge helps you create apps that are efficient and user-friendly.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Build Size:** The size of the compiled app file (APK for Android, IPA for iOS), affecting download time and storage.
*   **Asset Optimization:** The process of reducing the size of images, fonts, and other assets in your app.
*   **Tree-Shaking:** The process of removing unused code from the final build, reducing app size.
*   **Release Build:** An optimized build of your app for production, smaller and faster than debug builds.
*   **Code Splitting:** A technique for splitting code into smaller chunks that are loaded only when needed.
