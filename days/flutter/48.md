# Day 48: API Integration - Advanced Model Classes & Factory Methods

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Implement toJson:** Add a `toJson` method to your model class that converts the instance back to a JSON Map (useful for POST requests).
2.  **Handle Nested Objects:** Learn how to handle JSON with nested objects (e.g., a User object containing an Address object).
3.  **Handle Lists in JSON:** Create model classes for JSON arrays and handle lists of objects in your API responses.
4.  **Handle Nullable Fields:** Use nullable types (`String?`, `int?`) to handle optional or missing fields in JSON.
5.  **Practice with Complex JSON:** Work with a more complex JSON structure that includes nested objects, arrays, and optional fields.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll expand your model class knowledge to handle more complex scenarios. You'll learn how to convert your model instances back to JSON (useful when sending data to APIs), and how to handle nested structures and arrays.

Real-world APIs often return complex JSON with nested objects and arrays. For example, a user object might contain an address object, or a post might have a list of comments. You'll learn how to create separate model classes for nested objects and how to parse them.

You'll also learn about nullable types, which are essential because API responses may not always include all fields, or some fields might be null. Using nullable types (`String?`, `int?`) allows your code to handle these cases safely.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to create comprehensive model classes that handle complex JSON structures, nested objects, arrays, and nullable fields. You'll be able to convert data both ways (from JSON to Dart and from Dart to JSON), which is essential for full API integration. This knowledge will enable you to work with any API structure.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **`toJson`:** A method that converts a model instance back into a JSON Map, useful for sending data to APIs.
*   **Nested Object:** An object that is contained within another object, requiring a separate model class for the nested structure.
*   **Nullable Type:** A type that can hold a value or `null`, indicated by a `?` in Dart (e.g., `String?`, `int?`).
*   **JSON Array:** A JSON structure that contains an ordered list of values, represented as a `List` in Dart.
*   **Optional Field:** A field in JSON that may or may not be present, requiring nullable types in the model class.
