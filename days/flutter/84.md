# Day 84: Animations - CustomPaint Basics

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand CustomPaint:** Learn what `CustomPaint` is and when to use it (custom graphics, charts, complex shapes).
2.  **Explore Canvas API:** Understand the `Canvas` API and its drawing methods (`drawLine`, `drawCircle`, `drawRect`, etc.).
3.  **Create CustomPainter:** Create a class that extends `CustomPainter` to define custom drawing logic.
4.  **Draw Basic Shapes:** Use `Canvas` methods to draw lines, circles, rectangles, and paths.
5.  **Practice Project:** Build a simple custom widget using `CustomPaint` (e.g., a custom progress indicator, a simple chart, or a decorative shape).

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn about `CustomPaint`, which allows you to draw custom graphics directly on the screen. While Flutter provides many built-in widgets, sometimes you need custom graphics that aren't available as widgets.

`CustomPaint` uses a `CustomPainter` class that defines what to draw. The `CustomPainter` receives a `Canvas` object, which provides methods for drawing:
- **`drawLine()`:** Draw lines
- **`drawCircle()`:** Draw circles
- **`drawRect()`:** Draw rectangles
- **`drawPath()`:** Draw custom paths (complex shapes)
- **`drawText()`:** Draw text
- And many more...

You'll create a class that extends `CustomPainter` and implements the `paint()` method, where you use the `Canvas` to draw your graphics. You can also implement `shouldRepaint()` to optimize when the custom paint needs to be redrawn.

This is useful for creating custom charts, progress indicators, decorative elements, or any graphics that aren't available as standard widgets.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand `CustomPaint` and how to create custom graphics in Flutter. You'll be able to draw custom shapes, lines, and graphics that aren't available as standard widgets. This knowledge enables you to create unique, custom visual elements for your apps.
