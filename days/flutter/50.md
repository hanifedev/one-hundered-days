# Day 50: API Integration - Practice Project & Review

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Project Goal:** Enhance your Day 45 project by integrating proper model classes and JSON serialization.
2.  **Refactor to Use Models:** Replace `Map<String, dynamic>` usage with your custom model classes.
3.  **Implement Full CRUD:** If applicable, add the ability to create, update, and delete resources via API (using POST, PUT, DELETE).
4.  **Error Handling:** Ensure comprehensive error handling for all API operations.
5.  **Code Review:** Review your API integration code, organize it into separate files (models, services), and add documentation.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll bring together everything you've learned about API integration by enhancing your previous project with proper model classes and comprehensive API operations. This will give you a complete, production-ready example of API integration.

Refactoring to use model classes will make your code much cleaner and type-safe. You'll organize your code into logical files: model classes in one file, API service functions in another. This separation of concerns makes your code more maintainable.

If your chosen API supports it, implement full CRUD operations. This will give you experience with all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and how to handle different types of API interactions. Make sure error handling is comprehensive—users should always know what's happening, whether it's loading, success, or error states.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have a complete, well-organized API integration in your Flutter app. You'll have experience with model classes, JSON serialization, all HTTP methods, error handling, and code organization. This project will serve as a strong portfolio piece demonstrating your ability to integrate with real-world APIs professionally.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **CRUD Operations:** The four basic operations for data management: Create (POST), Read (GET), Update (PUT), Delete (DELETE).
*   **Code Refactoring:** The process of restructuring existing code to improve its structure, readability, or maintainability without changing its functionality.
*   **Separation of Concerns:** A design principle that separates code into distinct sections, each handling a specific aspect of functionality (e.g., models, services, UI).
*   **API Service:** A class or set of functions dedicated to handling all API-related operations, keeping API logic separate from UI code.
*   **Production-Ready:** Code that is well-structured, error-handled, and ready for real-world use.
