# Day 76: Responsive UI - MediaQuery and Screen Sizes

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Responsive Design:** Learn what responsive design means and why it's important for mobile apps (different screen sizes, orientations).
2.  **Explore MediaQuery:** Understand `MediaQuery` and how it provides information about the device's screen size and properties.
3.  **Access Screen Dimensions:** Use `MediaQuery.of(context).size` to get screen width and height.
4.  **Handle Orientation Changes:** Learn how to detect and respond to device orientation changes (portrait/landscape).
5.  **Practice Project:** Build a simple layout that adapts to different screen sizes using `MediaQuery`.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn about responsive design, which is essential for building apps that work well on different devices. Mobile devices come in many sizes—from small phones to large tablets—and your app should adapt to provide the best experience on each.

`MediaQuery` is Flutter's tool for accessing information about the device and screen. It provides:
- Screen size (width and height)
- Device pixel ratio
- Text scale factor
- Orientation
- Padding (safe areas, notches)

You'll use `MediaQuery.of(context).size` to get the screen dimensions and adjust your layout accordingly. For example, you might show a different layout on tablets (wider screens) than on phones (narrower screens).

Handling orientation changes is also important. Users can rotate their devices, and your app should adapt. You can detect orientation using `MediaQuery.of(context).orientation` and adjust your layout accordingly.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand responsive design and how to use `MediaQuery` to create layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and orientations. This knowledge enables you to build apps that provide a great experience on all devices.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Responsive Design:** The practice of designing UIs that adapt to different screen sizes, orientations, and device types.
*   **`MediaQuery`:** A Flutter widget that provides information about the device's screen size, orientation, and other media properties.
*   **Screen Dimensions:** The width and height of the device's screen, accessible via `MediaQuery.of(context).size`.
*   **Orientation:** The device's orientation (portrait or landscape), which can change when the user rotates the device.
*   **Device Pixel Ratio:** The ratio between physical pixels and logical pixels, important for handling high-density displays.
