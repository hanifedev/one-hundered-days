# Day 57: Local Data Storage - CRUD Operations (Part 1)

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand CRUD:** Review the four basic database operations: Create, Read, Update, Delete.
2.  **Create Data Models:** Create model classes for your data that are compatible with your chosen database (Hive adapters or SQLite tables).
3.  **Implement Create (Insert):** Write functions to insert new records into your database.
4.  **Implement Read (Query):** Write functions to retrieve data from your database (get all, get by ID, search).
5.  **Practice:** Create a simple app that can add and display items stored locally (e.g., a notes app, a todo list).

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn how to perform CRUD operations with your local database. CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, Delete—the four fundamental operations for working with data.

You'll start by creating data models. If you're using Hive, you'll need to create Hive adapters for your model classes. If you're using SQLite, you'll define table schemas. These models define the structure of your data.

Then you'll implement Create and Read operations. Creating involves inserting new records into your database. Reading involves querying the database to retrieve data. You'll learn different ways to query: getting all records, getting a specific record by ID, or searching/filtering records.

You'll practice by building a simple app that stores data locally. This hands-on experience will help you understand how local databases work in practice.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to create and read data from a local database. You'll understand how to structure your data models for local storage and how to perform basic database operations. This is the foundation for building apps with offline capabilities.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **CRUD:** An acronym for Create, Read, Update, Delete—the four basic operations for managing data in a database.
*   **Hive Adapter:** A class that tells Hive how to serialize and deserialize your model class to/from binary format.
*   **Table Schema:** The structure definition of a database table, including column names, types, and constraints.
*   **Query:** A request to retrieve data from a database, often with specific conditions or filters.
*   **Record:** A single entry or row in a database table, representing one instance of your data model.
