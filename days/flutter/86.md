# Day 86: Advanced Navigation - Introduction to Navigator 2.0

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Navigator 2.0:** Learn what Navigator 2.0 is and why it was introduced (declarative navigation, better control, web support).
2.  **Compare Navigator 1.0 vs 2.0:** Understand the differences between the imperative (1.0) and declarative (2.0) navigation approaches.
3.  **Understand RouterDelegate:** Learn about `RouterDelegate`, which manages the navigation stack in Navigator 2.0.
4.  **Understand RouteInformationParser:** Learn about `RouteInformationParser`, which parses route information (URLs, deep links).
5.  **Explore GoRouter (Alternative):** Learn about `go_router` package, which simplifies Navigator 2.0 implementation.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll be introduced to Navigator 2.0, which is a more powerful and flexible navigation system than Navigator 1.0. While Navigator 1.0 uses an imperative approach (push/pop), Navigator 2.0 uses a declarative approach, giving you more control over navigation.

Navigator 2.0 was introduced to:
- Support web URLs and deep linking better
- Provide more control over the navigation stack
- Enable declarative navigation (state-driven)
- Support complex navigation scenarios

The core components are:
- **`RouterDelegate`:** Manages the navigation stack and builds the appropriate widgets
- **`RouteInformationParser`:** Parses route information (like URLs) into app state
- **`RouteInformationProvider`:** Provides route information (like browser URL changes)

However, Navigator 2.0 can be complex. That's where `go_router` comes in—it's a package that simplifies Navigator 2.0 while providing its benefits. Many developers prefer `go_router` for its simpler API.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand Navigator 2.0 and its advantages over Navigator 1.0. You'll be familiar with the core concepts and know about `go_router` as a simpler alternative. This knowledge prepares you for implementing advanced navigation in your apps.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Navigator 2.0:** Flutter's declarative navigation system that provides more control and better web/deep linking support.
*   **Declarative Navigation:** A navigation approach where you describe the desired navigation state, and the system handles the transitions.
*   **`RouterDelegate`:** A class that manages the navigation stack and builds widgets based on the current route state.
*   **`RouteInformationParser`:** A class that parses route information (URLs, deep links) into application state.
*   **`go_router`:** A popular package that simplifies Navigator 2.0 implementation with a more intuitive API.
