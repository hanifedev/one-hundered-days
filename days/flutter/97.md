# Day 97: Performance - Memory Analysis and Optimization

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Memory Management:** Learn how Flutter manages memory and common memory issues (leaks, excessive allocations).
2.  **Use Memory Tab:** Explore the Memory tab in DevTools to monitor memory usage over time.
3.  **Identify Memory Leaks:** Learn how to identify memory leaks using DevTools (objects that aren't being garbage collected).
4.  **Optimize Widget Rebuilds:** Learn techniques to minimize unnecessary widget rebuilds (using `const`, `RepaintBoundary`, etc.).
5.  **Practice Optimization:** Optimize a previous project by identifying and fixing memory issues.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn about memory management and optimization. Memory issues can cause apps to slow down, crash, or drain battery. Understanding how to identify and fix memory problems is crucial for building stable apps.

The Memory tab in DevTools shows:
- Memory usage over time
- Object allocations
- Garbage collection events
- Memory leaks (objects that should be freed but aren't)

Common memory issues include:
- **Memory Leaks:** Objects that aren't properly disposed (e.g., listeners, streams, controllers)
- **Excessive Allocations:** Creating too many objects unnecessarily
- **Large Objects:** Holding references to large objects longer than needed

You'll learn optimization techniques:
- Use `const` widgets to prevent unnecessary rebuilds
- Use `RepaintBoundary` to isolate expensive repaints
- Properly dispose of controllers, streams, and listeners
- Avoid creating objects in `build()` methods

You'll practice by analyzing a previous project and identifying memory issues, then fixing them.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand memory management in Flutter and how to identify and fix memory issues. You'll be able to use DevTools to monitor memory and optimize your apps for better performance and stability. This knowledge is essential for building production-ready applications.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Memory Leak:** A situation where objects are not properly freed from memory, causing memory usage to grow over time.
*   **Garbage Collection:** The automatic process of freeing memory that's no longer in use.
*   **Memory Profiling:** The process of analyzing memory usage to identify leaks and optimization opportunities.
*   **`RepaintBoundary`:** A widget that isolates repaints, preventing expensive repaints from affecting the entire widget tree.
*   **Memory Optimization:** Techniques for reducing memory usage and preventing memory leaks.
