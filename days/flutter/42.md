# Day 42: API Integration - Making GET Requests

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand async/await with HTTP:** Review how `async`/`await` works with HTTP requests (since HTTP requests are asynchronous).
2.  **Build a Data Fetching Function:** Create a function that uses `http.get()` to fetch data from an API endpoint.
3.  **Handle Response Status:** Check the response status code (200 for success, 404 for not found, etc.) before processing the data.
4.  **Parse Response Body:** Extract and work with the response body, which is typically a JSON string.
5.  **Display Data in UI:** Create a simple app that fetches data from an API and displays it in a `ListView` or `Card` widget.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll dive deeper into making GET requests and learn how to properly handle asynchronous operations. HTTP requests take time to complete (network latency), so they're asynchronous operations. You'll use `async`/`await` to wait for the response before continuing.

It's important to check the status code of the response. A status code of 200 means the request was successful, while codes like 404 (not found) or 500 (server error) indicate problems. Always check the status before trying to use the response data.

The response body is typically a JSON string, which you'll need to parse (convert from string to Dart objects) in the coming days. For now, you'll work with the raw string to understand the structure. You'll also learn how to integrate this data fetching into your UI, which requires understanding how to update the UI when asynchronous data arrives.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to make GET requests, handle responses properly, and display fetched data in your Flutter app. You'll understand how to work with asynchronous operations in the context of HTTP requests and how to integrate API data into your user interface.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Asynchronous Operation:** An operation that doesn't block the execution of other code. HTTP requests are asynchronous because they take time to complete.
*   **Status Code:** A three-digit number returned by the server indicating the result of an HTTP request (200 = success, 404 = not found, 500 = server error).
*   **Response Body:** The actual data content returned by the server, typically in JSON format for REST APIs.
*   **Endpoint:** A specific URL that represents a resource or service provided by an API.
