# Day 95: Platform Channels - Practice Project & Review

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Project Goal:** Build a simple app that uses platform channels to access native features (e.g., device info, battery level, or a custom native feature).
2.  **Implement Method Channels:** Create method channels for both Android and iOS to access platform-specific functionality.
3.  **Handle Platform Differences:** Write platform-specific code that works on both Android and iOS.
4.  **Test on Both Platforms:** Test your platform channel implementation on both Android and iOS devices/emulators.
5.  **Document Your Implementation:** Document how your platform channels work and when to use them.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll apply everything you've learned about platform channels by building a complete implementation. This project will help you understand how to integrate native features into your Flutter app.

Choose a feature that requires platform channels. Good examples include:
- Getting detailed device information
- Accessing battery level or charging status
- Using platform-specific sensors
- Integrating with a native library

Implement the method channel in Dart, then write the native code for both Android and iOS. Make sure to handle platform differences—some features might work differently on each platform, or might not be available on one platform.

Test thoroughly on both platforms. Platform channels can behave differently on Android and iOS, and you want to ensure your implementation works correctly on both.

Document your implementation, especially if it's custom code. Future you (or other developers) will appreciate clear documentation of how the platform channels work and what they do.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have built a complete implementation using platform channels. You'll have practical experience in writing both Dart and native code, handling platform differences, and integrating native features into Flutter apps. This knowledge enables you to access any platform-specific feature when needed.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Platform Integration:** The process of integrating native platform features into a Flutter application using platform channels.
*   **Cross-Platform Native Code:** Native code implementations for both Android and iOS that provide the same functionality.
*   **Platform-Specific Feature:** A feature that's only available or works differently on a specific platform, requiring platform channels.
*   **Native Code Integration:** The practice of combining Flutter (Dart) code with native (Kotlin/Swift) code to access platform capabilities.
*   **Platform Channel Implementation:** A complete setup of platform channels, including Dart code, Android code, and iOS code.
