# Day 79: Theming - Dark Mode and Light Mode

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Dark Mode:** Learn what dark mode is and why it's important for user experience (reduced eye strain, battery savings on OLED screens).
2.  **Create Dark Theme:** Create a `ThemeData` for dark mode with appropriate colors (dark backgrounds, light text).
3.  **Set Theme Mode:** Use `MaterialApp`'s `themeMode` parameter to control which theme is active (light, dark, or system).
4.  **Implement Theme Toggle:** Add functionality to switch between light and dark themes (using a switch, button, or setting).
5.  **Persist Theme Preference:** Save the user's theme preference using `shared_preferences` so it persists across app restarts.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn how to implement dark mode, which has become a standard feature in modern apps. Dark mode provides a dark color scheme that's easier on the eyes in low-light conditions and can save battery on OLED screens.

You'll create two themes: a light theme (default) and a dark theme. The dark theme should have:
- Dark backgrounds (dark gray or black)
- Light text (white or light gray)
- Adjusted accent colors that work well on dark backgrounds

You'll use `MaterialApp`'s `themeMode` parameter to control which theme is active. You can set it to:
- `ThemeMode.light`: Always use light theme
- `ThemeMode.dark`: Always use dark theme
- `ThemeMode.system`: Follow the device's system setting

You'll also implement a way for users to toggle between themes. This might be a switch in settings or a button. Finally, you'll save the user's preference using `shared_preferences` so their choice persists when they restart the app.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to implement dark mode in your Flutter app. You'll understand how to create dark themes, toggle between themes, and persist user preferences. This knowledge enables you to build modern apps that provide a great user experience in both light and dark modes.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Dark Mode:** A color scheme with dark backgrounds and light text, designed for low-light environments and OLED displays.
*   **`ThemeMode`:** An enum that controls which theme is active: `light`, `dark`, or `system` (follows device setting).
*   **Theme Toggle:** A UI control (switch, button) that allows users to switch between light and dark themes.
*   **Theme Persistence:** Saving the user's theme preference so it remains selected after the app is closed and reopened.
*   **System Theme:** Following the device's system-wide theme setting, automatically switching when the user changes their device theme.
