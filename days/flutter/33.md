# Day 33: State Management - Building a To-Do App (Part 2)

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Implement Toggle Functionality:** Add the ability to mark todos as completed or uncompleted (toggle the `isCompleted` property).
2.  **Add Delete Functionality:** Implement a way to delete todos from the list (e.g., swipe to delete or a delete button).
3.  **Visual Feedback:** Update the UI to visually distinguish completed todos from incomplete ones (e.g., strikethrough text, different colors).
4.  **Empty State:** Add a message or illustration that displays when there are no todos in the list.
5.  **Polish the UI:** Improve the overall design with better spacing, colors, and typography.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll continue building your To-Do app by adding essential functionality: toggling completion status and deleting todos. These features will require you to update the state of your todo list, which means using `setState()` to modify the list and trigger UI updates.

For toggling, you'll need to find the specific todo in your list and update its `isCompleted` property. For deletion, you'll need to remove the todo from the list entirely. Both operations require careful state management to ensure the UI reflects the changes correctly.

Visual feedback is important for user experience. Users should be able to quickly distinguish between completed and incomplete tasks. Consider using a `Checkbox`, changing text decoration (strikethrough), or adjusting colors to provide clear visual cues.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have a more complete To-Do application with core CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality. You'll have gained experience in modifying lists in state, implementing interactive features, and providing visual feedback to users. These are fundamental skills for building any data-driven Flutter application.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **CRUD:** An acronym for Create, Read, Update, Delete—the four basic operations for managing data.
*   **State Mutation:** The process of modifying the state of a widget, which should always be done within `setState()`.
*   **Empty State:** A UI state that displays when there is no data to show, often used to guide users on what to do next.
*   **Visual Feedback:** UI changes that inform users about the result of their actions (e.g., color changes, animations).
