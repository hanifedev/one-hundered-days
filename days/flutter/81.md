# Day 81: Animations - Introduction to Implicit Animations

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Animations:** Learn what animations are and why they're important for modern UX (smooth transitions, visual feedback).
2.  **Explore Implicit Animations:** Understand the difference between implicit and explicit animations (implicit = automatic, explicit = manual control).
3.  **Use AnimatedContainer:** Learn `AnimatedContainer`, which automatically animates changes to its properties (color, size, padding, etc.).
4.  **Control Animation Duration:** Use `duration` parameter to control how long animations take.
5.  **Practice Project:** Build a simple widget that animates when its properties change (e.g., a button that grows/shrinks, a card that changes color).

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll be introduced to animations in Flutter, which are essential for creating smooth, polished user experiences. Animations provide visual feedback, guide user attention, and make apps feel more responsive and professional.

Flutter offers two main types of animations:
- **Implicit Animations:** Automatic animations that happen when properties change (e.g., `AnimatedContainer`, `AnimatedOpacity`)
- **Explicit Animations:** Manual animations with full control over the animation (covered later)

You'll start with implicit animations, which are simpler and perfect for most use cases. `AnimatedContainer` is a great starting point—it's like a regular `Container`, but it automatically animates when you change its properties (color, size, padding, etc.).

You'll control animation speed using the `duration` parameter, which specifies how long the animation should take. You can also use `curve` to control the animation's timing (e.g., ease-in, ease-out).

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand animations and how to use implicit animations in Flutter. You'll be able to create smooth transitions when properties change, making your app feel more polished and responsive. This knowledge is the foundation for all animation work in Flutter.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Animation:** A visual effect that creates the illusion of motion or change over time, making UI transitions smooth and polished.
*   **Implicit Animation:** An automatic animation that occurs when a widget's properties change, requiring minimal code.
*   **`AnimatedContainer`:** A widget that automatically animates changes to its properties (size, color, padding, etc.).
*   **Animation Duration:** The length of time an animation takes to complete, typically specified in milliseconds or seconds.
*   **Animation Curve:** A function that defines how an animation progresses over time (e.g., linear, ease-in, ease-out).
