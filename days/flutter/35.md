# Day 35: State Management - To-Do App Finalization & Review

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Final Polish:** Review your To-Do app and add any final touches (animations, better styling, accessibility improvements).
2.  **Test Your App:** Manually test all features to ensure everything works as expected (add, edit, delete, toggle, filter).
3.  **Code Review:** Review your code for potential improvements, remove any unused code, and ensure consistent formatting.
4.  **Documentation:** Add comments to your code explaining complex logic or important decisions.
5.  **Reflection:** Write down what you learned during this project and what challenges you faced.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today is about finalizing your To-Do app and reflecting on what you've learned. This is an important step in the development process—taking time to polish, test, and review your work will help you develop good habits as a developer.

Testing is crucial. Go through each feature systematically and make sure everything works as expected. Try edge cases: what happens if you try to add an empty todo? What if you try to delete a todo that doesn't exist? Thinking about these scenarios will help you become a more thorough developer.

Code review, even if it's just reviewing your own code, is a valuable practice. Look for opportunities to simplify, improve readability, or fix potential bugs. Adding comments will help you (and others) understand your code in the future.

Finally, take time to reflect on your learning. What concepts became clearer? What was challenging? This reflection will help solidify your understanding and guide your future learning.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have completed your first substantial Flutter project. You'll have gained experience in the full development cycle: planning, building, testing, and polishing. This project demonstrates your ability to manage state, handle user input, and build a functional application. More importantly, you'll have developed good development practices that will serve you throughout your Flutter journey.
