# Day 32: State Management - Building a To-Do App (Part 1)

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Project Setup:** Create a new Flutter project for your To-Do application.
2.  **Design the Data Model:** Create a simple `Todo` class with properties like `id`, `title`, `isCompleted`, and `createdAt`.
3.  **Build the UI Structure:** Design the main screen layout with an input field for adding new todos and a list to display existing todos.
4.  **Implement Add Functionality:** Create a function that adds a new todo to a list when the user submits the input field.
5.  **Display Todos:** Use a `ListView` or `ListView.builder` to display all todos in the list.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today marks the beginning of your first substantial Flutter project: a To-Do application. This project will help you apply everything you've learned about state management, user input, and layout in a practical way.

Start by thinking about the data structure. A `Todo` class will help you organize the information for each task. Then, you'll need to manage a list of todos in your widget's state. When a user adds a new todo, you'll use `setState()` to update the list and trigger a UI rebuild.

The UI structure should be intuitive: an input field at the top (or bottom) for adding new todos, and a scrollable list below to show all existing todos. This is a common pattern in mobile applications, and you'll be implementing it using the layout widgets you've already learned.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have started building a functional To-Do application. You'll have practical experience in managing a list of items in state, handling user input to add new items, and displaying dynamic lists in Flutter. This foundation will be built upon in the coming days as you add more features.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Data Model:** A class that represents the structure of data in your application (e.g., `Todo` class).
*   **`ListView`:** A scrollable widget that displays a list of children widgets.
*   **`ListView.builder`:** A more efficient version of `ListView` that builds children on demand, useful for long lists.
*   **State Management:** The process of managing and updating the data that determines what is displayed in the UI.
