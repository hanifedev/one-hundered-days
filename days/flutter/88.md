# Day 88: Advanced Navigation - Deep Linking

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Deep Linking:** Learn what deep linking is and why it's important (opening specific screens via URLs, sharing links).
2.  **Set Up Deep Links:** Configure your app to handle deep links (Android: intent filters, iOS: URL schemes, Web: routes).
3.  **Handle Route Parameters:** Learn how to extract parameters from deep link URLs (e.g., /product/:id).
4.  **Handle Query Parameters:** Learn how to handle query parameters in URLs (e.g., /search?q=flutter).
5.  **Test Deep Links:** Test deep links on different platforms (Android, iOS, Web) to ensure they work correctly.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn about deep linking, which allows users to open specific screens in your app via URLs. This is essential for:
- Sharing content (users can share links to specific items)
- Web support (your app works with browser URLs)
- Push notifications (opening specific screens when users tap notifications)
- Marketing campaigns (directing users to specific content)

With `go_router`, deep linking works automatically once you set up your routes correctly. You define routes with parameters (e.g., '/product/:id'), and `go_router` handles parsing the URL and passing parameters to your page builder.

You'll also learn to handle query parameters (e.g., '/search?q=flutter&category=mobile'). These are useful for search, filtering, and other scenarios where you need to pass multiple optional parameters.

Platform-specific setup is required:
- **Android:** Configure intent filters in `AndroidManifest.xml`
- **iOS:** Configure URL schemes in `Info.plist`
- **Web:** Works automatically with proper route configuration

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand deep linking and how to implement it in your Flutter apps. You'll be able to handle route parameters, query parameters, and configure deep links for different platforms. This knowledge enables you to build apps that support sharing, web URLs, and better user experiences.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Deep Linking:** The ability to open specific screens in an app via URLs, enabling sharing and web support.
*   **URL Scheme:** A protocol (e.g., 'myapp://') that identifies your app for deep linking on iOS.
*   **Intent Filter:** Android configuration that allows your app to handle specific URL patterns for deep linking.
*   **Route Parameters:** Variables in route paths (e.g., ':id' in '/product/:id') that are extracted from URLs.
*   **Query Parameters:** Optional parameters in URLs (e.g., '?q=flutter') that provide additional information.
