# Day 40: Navigation - Practice Project & Review

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Project Goal:** Build a multi-screen application (e.g., a simple news app, a recipe app, or a product catalog).
2.  **Implement Navigation:** Use named routes to navigate between at least three different screens.
3.  **Pass Data:** Pass data between screens (e.g., from a list screen to a details screen).
4.  **Handle Back Navigation:** Ensure proper back navigation behavior and handle edge cases.
5.  **Review and Reflect:** Review what you've learned about navigation and identify areas for improvement.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll apply all the navigation concepts you've learned over the past few days by building a complete multi-screen application. This project will help you solidify your understanding of navigation, data passing, and navigation patterns.

Choose a project that requires multiple screens and data flow between them. For example, a news app might have a home screen with a list of articles, a details screen showing a full article, and a settings screen. This will give you practice with all the navigation techniques you've learned.

Pay attention to the user experience. Make sure back navigation works intuitively, and consider using `pushReplacement` or `pushAndRemoveUntil` where appropriate (e.g., after completing a critical action). Test edge cases: what happens if the user presses back multiple times? What if they navigate quickly between screens?

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have built a complete multi-screen application using all the navigation techniques you've learned. You'll have practical experience with named routes, data passing, and advanced navigation patterns. This project will demonstrate your ability to build applications with proper navigation structure, which is a fundamental requirement for any real-world Flutter application.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Multi-Screen Application:** An application that consists of multiple screens or views that users can navigate between.
*   **Navigation Flow:** The sequence of screens a user navigates through to complete a task or access information.
*   **User Experience (UX):** The overall experience a user has when interacting with an application, including ease of navigation and intuitiveness.
*   **Edge Case:** A scenario that occurs at the extreme ends of normal operation, such as rapid navigation or unusual user behavior.
