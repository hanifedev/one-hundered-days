# Day 55: State Management - Provider Practice Project & Review

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Project Goal:** Build a complete app (e.g., a note-taking app, a task manager, or a simple social feed) using Provider for state management.
2.  **Design State Structure:** Plan your app's state management architecture—identify what state needs to be managed and create appropriate `ChangeNotifier` classes.
3.  **Implement Multiple Providers:** Use multiple providers for different features (e.g., notes provider, user provider, theme provider).
4.  **Optimize with Selector:** Use `Selector` widgets to optimize performance by only listening to necessary state changes.
5.  **Code Organization:** Organize your providers into separate files and follow best practices for state management architecture.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll apply everything you've learned about Provider by building a complete application. This project will help you understand how to structure state management in a real-world scenario.

Start by planning your state architecture. Think about what data needs to be shared across widgets and what can stay local. Create separate `ChangeNotifier` classes for different features or domains. This separation makes your code more maintainable and testable.

Use `Selector` widgets strategically to optimize performance. Only widgets that actually need to update when specific state changes should be wrapped with `Consumer` or `Selector`. This prevents unnecessary rebuilds and keeps your app fast.

Organize your code professionally: put providers in a `providers` folder, keep business logic separate from UI, and follow consistent naming conventions. This will make your codebase easier to understand and maintain.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have built a complete application using Provider for state management. You'll have practical experience in architecting state management, using multiple providers, optimizing performance, and organizing code professionally. This project will demonstrate your ability to build maintainable, scalable Flutter applications.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **State Architecture:** The overall design and organization of state management in an application, including how state is divided and shared.
*   **Domain:** A specific area or feature of an application (e.g., user domain, product domain, order domain).
*   **Best Practices:** Established methods and techniques that are widely accepted as the most effective way to solve common problems.
*   **Code Organization:** The practice of structuring code files and folders in a logical, maintainable way.
*   **Scalability:** The ability of code to handle growth and increased complexity without becoming unmaintainable.
