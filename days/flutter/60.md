# Day 60: Local Data Storage - Practice Project & Review

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Project Goal:** Build a complete app with local data storage (e.g., a personal notes app, a habit tracker, or a budget manager).
2.  **Implement Full CRUD:** Ensure all CRUD operations work correctly with your local database.
3.  **Use Repository Pattern:** Structure your data layer using the Repository pattern for clean architecture.
4.  **Integrate with Provider:** Combine local storage with Provider for state management, ensuring UI updates when data changes.
5.  **Test Persistence:** Verify that data persists correctly when the app is closed and reopened.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll build a complete application that uses local data storage. This project will bring together everything you've learned: CRUD operations, the Repository pattern, and state management with Provider.

Your app should have full CRUD functionality, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete data. Use the Repository pattern to structure your data layer cleanly. This separation will make your code more maintainable and testable.

Integrate your repository with Provider so that when data changes in the database, your UI automatically updates. This creates a seamless user experience where the UI always reflects the current state of the data.

Finally, test that your data actually persists. Close the app completely, reopen it, and verify that your data is still there. This is the whole point of local storage—data should survive app restarts.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have built a complete application with local data storage using best practices. You'll have experience with CRUD operations, the Repository pattern, and integrating local storage with state management. This project demonstrates your ability to build apps with offline capabilities and proper data architecture.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Offline-First:** An application design approach where the app is designed to work primarily with local data, syncing with servers when possible.
*   **Data Persistence:** The ability of data to remain stored and accessible after the application is closed and reopened.
*   **State Synchronization:** The process of keeping UI state in sync with the underlying data source (database, API, etc.).
*   **Clean Architecture:** A software design approach that separates concerns into distinct layers (UI, business logic, data) for better maintainability.
*   **Production Application:** An application that is ready for real-world use, with proper architecture, error handling, and data persistence.
