# Day 93: Platform Channels - Implementing Method Channels (iOS)

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Set Up iOS Project:** Understand the iOS project structure in a Flutter app.
2.  **Create Method Channel:** Set up a `MethodChannel` in your Dart code (same as Android, but iOS implementation differs).
3.  **Implement iOS Handler:** Write Swift/Objective-C code in iOS to handle method calls from Dart.
4.  **Call Native Methods:** Call native iOS methods from Dart and receive results.
5.  **Handle Platform Differences:** Understand how to handle platform-specific code for both Android and iOS.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn how to implement platform channels for iOS, similar to Android but using Swift or Objective-C. The Dart side is the same (you use the same `MethodChannel`), but the native implementation differs.

In your iOS code (Swift or Objective-C), you'll set up a method channel handler using `FlutterMethodChannel`. You'll register method handlers that receive calls from Dart and execute native iOS code.

The structure is similar to Android:
- Dart calls `invokeMethod()` on the channel
- iOS receives the call in the handler
- iOS executes native code
- iOS returns the result to Dart

Common iOS operations you might implement:
- Accessing iOS frameworks (HealthKit, CoreLocation, etc.)
- Using iOS-specific APIs
- Integrating with iOS libraries
- Accessing device information

You'll also learn how to structure your code to support both Android and iOS, using platform checks in Dart to call the appropriate native code.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to implement method channels for iOS. You'll understand how to set up communication between Dart and iOS native code, call native methods, and handle platform differences. Combined with Android knowledge, this enables you to access platform-specific features on both platforms.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Method Channel (iOS):** A platform channel implementation for iOS that allows Dart to call Swift/Objective-C methods.
*   **`FlutterMethodChannel`:** The iOS class that handles method calls from Flutter.
*   **iOS Project Structure:** The organization of iOS-specific code in a Flutter project (typically in `ios/Runner/`).
*   **Native iOS Code:** Code written in Swift or Objective-C that runs on the iOS platform.
*   **Platform-Specific Implementation:** Different native code implementations for Android and iOS that provide the same functionality.
