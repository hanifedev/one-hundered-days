# Day 54: State Management - Multiple Providers and Provider Types

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Use Multiple Providers:** Learn how to use multiple `ChangeNotifierProvider`s in your app for different features.
2.  **Understand Provider Types:** Explore different Provider types: `Provider`, `ChangeNotifierProvider`, `FutureProvider`, `StreamProvider`.
3.  **Use MultiProvider:** Wrap your app with `MultiProvider` when you need multiple providers at the root level.
4.  **Access Multiple Providers:** Learn how to access multiple providers in a single widget using multiple `Consumer` widgets or `Provider.of()`.
5.  **Practice Project:** Build a simple shopping cart app with separate providers for products and cart state.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn how to work with multiple providers in your app. Real-world applications typically have multiple pieces of state that need to be managed separately (e.g., user authentication, shopping cart, theme preferences). You'll learn how to set up and use multiple providers.

Flutter's Provider package offers different types of providers for different use cases:
- `Provider`: For simple, immutable data
- `ChangeNotifierProvider`: For mutable state that changes over time
- `FutureProvider`: For data that comes from async operations (like API calls)
- `StreamProvider`: For data that comes from streams

You'll also learn about `MultiProvider`, which allows you to provide multiple providers at once, making your code cleaner when you have many providers.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to manage multiple pieces of state using multiple providers. You'll understand different provider types and when to use each one. This knowledge will enable you to build complex applications with well-organized state management.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **`MultiProvider`:** A widget that allows you to provide multiple providers at once, useful when you have many providers at the root level.
*   **`FutureProvider`:** A Provider type that provides data from a Future, automatically handling loading and error states.
*   **`StreamProvider`:** A Provider type that provides data from a Stream, automatically updating when new data arrives.
*   **Provider Scope:** The part of the widget tree where a Provider is available. Providers are available to all descendant widgets.
*   **State Separation:** The practice of dividing application state into logical, separate providers for different features or domains.
