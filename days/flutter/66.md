# Day 66: Unit Testing - Introduction and Setup

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Unit Testing:** Learn what unit testing is, why it's important, and what it means to test "units" of code.
2.  **Install Testing Packages:** Add `test` and `flutter_test` packages to your project (usually included by default).
3.  **Write Your First Test:** Create a simple test file and write a basic test for a pure function (e.g., a calculator function).
4.  **Understand Test Structure:** Learn the structure of a test: `test()` function, `expect()` assertions, and test descriptions.
5.  **Run Tests:** Learn how to run tests using `flutter test` command and understand test output.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll be introduced to unit testing, which is a crucial practice for building reliable, maintainable applications. Unit tests test individual "units" of code (functions, methods, classes) in isolation to ensure they work correctly.

Unit testing has many benefits:
- **Catch bugs early:** Find problems before they reach production
- **Documentation:** Tests serve as examples of how code should be used
- **Refactoring confidence:** Change code knowing tests will catch if you break something
- **Design improvement:** Writing tests often reveals design issues

You'll start with simple tests for pure functions (functions with no side effects). These are the easiest to test and will help you understand the basic structure: `test('description', () { expect(actual, matcher); });`

Flutter includes testing packages by default, so you can start writing tests immediately. You'll learn how to run tests and interpret the results.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand what unit testing is and why it's important. You'll be able to write basic unit tests and run them. This foundation is essential for building reliable applications and is a standard practice in professional development.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Unit Testing:** Testing individual units of code (functions, methods, classes) in isolation to verify they work correctly.
*   **Test:** A function that verifies a specific behavior or outcome of your code.
*   **Assertion:** A statement that checks if a condition is true (e.g., `expect(value, equals(5))`).
*   **Pure Function:** A function that always returns the same output for the same input and has no side effects, making it easy to test.
*   **`flutter_test` Package:** Flutter's testing package that provides tools and matchers for writing tests.
