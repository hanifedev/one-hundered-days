# Day 47: API Integration - Creating Model Classes

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Model Classes:** Learn what model classes are and why they're important for type safety and code organization.
2.  **Design a Model:** Create a Dart class that represents the structure of data from your API (e.g., a `User` class, a `Post` class, a `Product` class).
3.  **Add Properties:** Define properties in your model class that match the JSON fields from the API response.
4.  **Create Constructors:** Add constructors to your model class, including a named constructor for creating instances from JSON.
5.  **Implement fromJson:** Create a `fromJson` factory constructor or method that converts JSON (Map) into a model instance.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn how to create model classes, which are strongly-typed representations of your API data. Instead of working with `Map<String, dynamic>`, you'll create specific classes like `User`, `Post`, or `Product` that represent your data structure.

Model classes provide several benefits: type safety (the compiler catches errors), better IDE support (autocomplete), and clearer, more maintainable code. They also make it easier to work with your data throughout your app.

You'll create a class with properties that match your JSON structure, then add a `fromJson` constructor that takes a `Map<String, dynamic>` and creates an instance of your model. This is the foundation of JSON serialization in Dart.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to create model classes that represent your API data. You'll understand how to convert JSON into strongly-typed Dart objects, which makes your code safer, more readable, and easier to maintain. This is a professional approach to handling API data.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Model Class:** A class that represents the structure and behavior of a specific type of data (e.g., User, Product, Post).
*   **Type Safety:** A programming language feature that ensures variables are used in ways consistent with their declared types, catching errors at compile time.
*   **Factory Constructor:** A constructor that can return an instance of a class, often used for creating instances from different data sources (like JSON).
*   **`fromJson`:** A common naming convention for a factory constructor or method that creates an object instance from JSON data.
*   **Property:** A variable that belongs to a class and represents a characteristic or attribute of the class.
