# Day 37: Navigation - Passing Data Between Screens

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Data Passing:** Learn why and how to pass data when navigating between screens.
2.  **Pass Data Forward:** Use constructor parameters to pass data from one screen to another when using `Navigator.push()`.
3.  **Return Data Back:** Use `Navigator.pop()` with a result parameter to return data to the previous screen.
4.  **Handle Returned Data:** Use `await` with `Navigator.push()` to receive data returned from a screen.
5.  **Practice Project:** Build a simple app where you select an item on one screen and display its details on another screen, then return with a result.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn how to pass data between screens, which is essential for building real-world applications. When you navigate to a details screen, you typically need to pass information about what item to display. When you return from a screen, you might need to pass back a result (e.g., a selected value, a confirmation).

Passing data forward is straightforward: you pass it as a parameter to the screen's constructor when you create it in `Navigator.push()`. Returning data is slightly more complex: you use `Navigator.pop()` with a result parameter, and you use `await` with `Navigator.push()` to receive that result.

This pattern is very common in Flutter apps. For example, you might navigate to a settings screen and return with updated settings, or navigate to a selection screen and return with the selected item.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to pass data between screens in both directions. You'll understand how to send data when navigating forward and how to receive data when returning. This knowledge is essential for building interactive, data-driven applications where screens need to communicate with each other.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Constructor Parameter:** A parameter passed to a class constructor when creating an instance of that class.
*   **Return Value:** Data that is returned from a function or, in this case, from a screen when it's popped from the navigation stack.
*   **`await`:** A keyword used with asynchronous operations to wait for the result before continuing execution.
*   **Data Flow:** The direction and method by which data moves between different parts of an application.
