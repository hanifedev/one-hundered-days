# Day 52: State Management - ChangeNotifier and NotifyListeners

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand ChangeNotifier:** Learn what `ChangeNotifier` is and why it's the foundation of Provider-based state management.
2.  **Create a Model Class:** Create a class that extends `ChangeNotifier` to manage your app's state.
3.  **Implement State Logic:** Add methods and properties to your `ChangeNotifier` class that represent your app's state and business logic.
4.  **Use notifyListeners():** Call `notifyListeners()` whenever the state changes to trigger UI updates.
5.  **Practice Project:** Refactor your To-Do app (from Days 32-35) to use Provider and `ChangeNotifier` instead of `setState()`.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll dive deeper into Provider by learning about `ChangeNotifier`, which is the core mechanism that makes Provider work. `ChangeNotifier` is a class that can notify its listeners when something changes. When you extend `ChangeNotifier` and call `notifyListeners()`, Provider automatically rebuilds the widgets that are listening to that state.

You'll create a model class (often called a "provider" or "notifier") that extends `ChangeNotifier`. This class will hold your app's state and contain methods that modify that state. Whenever you modify the state, you call `notifyListeners()`, which tells Provider to rebuild the widgets that depend on this state.

Refactoring your To-Do app is a great way to see the benefits of Provider. Instead of managing state in a `StatefulWidget` with `setState()`, you'll have a separate class that manages the todos, and any widget can access and modify that state easily.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand how `ChangeNotifier` works and how to create state management classes using it. You'll be able to separate your business logic from your UI, making your code more organized and testable. This is a crucial step toward professional Flutter development.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **`ChangeNotifier`:** A class in Flutter that can notify listeners when its state changes. It's the foundation of Provider-based state management.
*   **`notifyListeners()`:** A method in `ChangeNotifier` that notifies all registered listeners that the state has changed, triggering widget rebuilds.
*   **State Management Class:** A class (often extending `ChangeNotifier`) that holds and manages application state, separate from the UI.
*   **Business Logic:** The code that implements the rules and operations of your application, separate from the UI code.
*   **Separation of Concerns:** A design principle where different aspects of an application (UI, business logic, data) are kept separate.
