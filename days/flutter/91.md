# Day 91: Platform Channels - Introduction and Setup

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Platform Channels:** Learn what platform channels are and why they're needed (accessing native features not available in Flutter).
2.  **Explore Use Cases:** Understand common use cases for platform channels (camera, battery level, device info, native APIs).
3.  **Set Up Method Channels:** Learn how to set up method channels for communication between Dart and native code.
4.  **Understand Platform-Specific Code:** Learn about writing native code (Kotlin/Java for Android, Swift/Objective-C for iOS).
5.  **Explore Existing Packages:** Learn about popular packages that already provide platform channel implementations (e.g., `device_info_plus`, `battery_plus`).

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll be introduced to platform channels, which allow Flutter apps to communicate with native platform code (Kotlin/Swift). While Flutter provides many features, sometimes you need to access platform-specific APIs that aren't available in Flutter.

Platform channels enable:
- Accessing device features (camera, sensors, battery)
- Using native libraries and SDKs
- Implementing platform-specific functionality
- Integrating with existing native code

The communication works like this:
1. Dart code calls a method channel
2. Native code (Kotlin/Swift) receives the call
3. Native code performs the operation
4. Native code returns the result to Dart

However, before writing your own platform channels, check if a package already exists. The Flutter community has created packages for most common use cases (e.g., `camera`, `battery_plus`, `device_info_plus`). Only write custom platform channels when you need something specific that doesn't exist.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand platform channels and when to use them. You'll know about existing packages that provide platform functionality and understand the basics of how platform channels work. This knowledge prepares you for accessing native features when needed.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Platform Channel:** A mechanism that allows Flutter (Dart) code to communicate with native platform code (Kotlin/Swift).
*   **Method Channel:** A type of platform channel used for calling methods in native code and receiving results.
*   **Native Code:** Platform-specific code written in Kotlin/Java (Android) or Swift/Objective-C (iOS).
*   **Platform-Specific API:** An API that's only available on a specific platform (Android or iOS), requiring platform channels to access.
*   **Flutter Package:** Pre-built solutions that often include platform channel implementations for common use cases.
