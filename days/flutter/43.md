# Day 43: API Integration - Making POST Requests

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand POST Requests:** Learn when and why to use POST requests (creating new resources, sending data to the server).
2.  **Prepare Request Data:** Create a Map or JSON object containing the data you want to send to the server.
3.  **Make POST Request:** Use `http.post()` to send data to an API endpoint, including headers and body.
4.  **Handle POST Response:** Process the response from the server, which may include the created resource or a confirmation message.
5.  **Practice Project:** Build a simple form that sends data to an API (e.g., create a new post, add a comment, register a user).

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn about POST requests, which are used to send data to a server (as opposed to GET, which retrieves data). POST requests are essential for creating new resources, submitting forms, or sending any data that should be stored on the server.

When making a POST request, you need to include the data in the request body. This data is typically in JSON format. You'll also need to set the appropriate headers (like `Content-Type: application/json`) to tell the server what format the data is in.

The server will respond with a status code (often 201 for "created" or 200 for "success") and may return the created resource or a confirmation message. You'll learn how to handle these responses and update your UI accordingly.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to send data to servers using POST requests. You'll understand how to format data, set headers, and handle responses. This skill is essential for building interactive applications that allow users to create, update, or submit data.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **POST Request:** An HTTP method used to send data to a server, typically to create a new resource or submit information.
*   **Request Body:** The data sent to the server as part of a POST (or PUT) request, typically in JSON format.
*   **Headers:** Additional information sent with an HTTP request, such as `Content-Type` (specifying the data format) or `Authorization` (for authentication).
*   **Status Code 201:** HTTP status code meaning "Created," typically returned when a POST request successfully creates a new resource.
