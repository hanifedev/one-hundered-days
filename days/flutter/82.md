# Day 82: Animations - More Implicit Animation Widgets

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Use AnimatedOpacity:** Learn `AnimatedOpacity` for fading widgets in and out smoothly.
2.  **Use AnimatedPositioned:** Learn `AnimatedPositioned` for animating widget positions within a `Stack`.
3.  **Use AnimatedPadding:** Learn `AnimatedPadding` for animating padding changes.
4.  **Use AnimatedAlign:** Learn `AnimatedAlign` for animating alignment changes.
5.  **Combine Animations:** Create widgets that use multiple implicit animations together for complex effects.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll explore more implicit animation widgets beyond `AnimatedContainer`. Flutter provides many specialized animated widgets, each designed for animating specific properties.

`AnimatedOpacity` is perfect for fade effects—making widgets appear or disappear smoothly. It's commonly used for loading indicators, error messages, or showing/hiding content.

`AnimatedPositioned` works within a `Stack` and animates position changes. This is useful for sliding widgets around the screen or creating moving elements.

`AnimatedPadding` animates padding changes, which can create smooth layout shifts. `AnimatedAlign` animates alignment changes, useful for repositioning widgets smoothly.

You'll also learn to combine multiple animated widgets to create more complex effects. For example, you might use `AnimatedOpacity` and `AnimatedContainer` together to create a fade-and-grow effect.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be familiar with various implicit animation widgets and know when to use each one. You'll be able to create smooth animations for opacity, position, padding, and alignment changes. This expands your animation toolkit significantly.
