# Day 89: Advanced Navigation - Nested Navigation and Guards

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Nested Navigation:** Learn how to implement nested navigation (tabs with their own navigation stacks).
2.  **Use ShellRoute:** Learn about `ShellRoute` in `go_router` for creating nested navigation structures.
3.  **Implement Navigation Guards:** Add route guards to protect routes (e.g., require authentication before accessing certain screens).
4.  **Handle Redirects:** Use redirects to automatically navigate users based on conditions (e.g., redirect to login if not authenticated).
5.  **Practice Project:** Build an app with nested navigation (e.g., bottom navigation with multiple tabs, each with its own stack).

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn about advanced navigation patterns: nested navigation and route guards. These are common in real-world applications.

Nested navigation is when you have navigation within navigation. For example, a bottom navigation bar with multiple tabs, where each tab has its own navigation stack. This is common in apps like Instagram or Twitter, where you can navigate within each tab independently.

`go_router` provides `ShellRoute` for this purpose. It allows you to create a shell (like a scaffold with bottom navigation) that contains multiple child routes, each with its own navigation stack.

Route guards protect routes by checking conditions before allowing navigation. For example:
- Authentication guard: Check if user is logged in before accessing protected routes
- Role guard: Check if user has the right permissions
- Data guard: Ensure required data is loaded

You'll implement redirects that automatically send users to the right place based on their state (e.g., redirect to login if not authenticated, redirect to home if already logged in).

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand nested navigation and route guards. You'll be able to create complex navigation structures with multiple navigation stacks and protect routes with authentication or other conditions. This knowledge enables you to build production-ready apps with sophisticated navigation.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Nested Navigation:** Navigation within navigation, such as tabs with their own navigation stacks.
*   **`ShellRoute`:** A route type in `go_router` that creates a shell (container) for nested navigation.
*   **Route Guard:** A mechanism that checks conditions before allowing navigation to a route (e.g., authentication check).
*   **Redirect:** Automatic navigation to a different route based on conditions (e.g., redirect to login if not authenticated).
*   **Navigation Stack:** A stack of screens that users can navigate through, with back navigation support.
