# Day 46: API Integration - JSON Serialization Introduction

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand JSON:** Learn what JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is and why it's the standard format for API responses.
2.  **Explore JSON Structure:** Understand JSON syntax: objects (key-value pairs), arrays, strings, numbers, booleans, and null.
3.  **Manual JSON Parsing:** Use Dart's built-in `dart:convert` library to manually parse JSON strings into Dart objects.
4.  **Convert JSON to Dart:** Use `jsonDecode()` to convert a JSON string into a `Map<String, dynamic>` or `List<dynamic>`.
5.  **Access JSON Data:** Extract specific values from parsed JSON using map keys or list indices.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn about JSON, which is the most common format for API responses. JSON is a text-based data format that's easy for both humans and machines to read. Understanding JSON is crucial because almost all modern APIs use it.

You'll start with manual JSON parsing using Dart's built-in `dart:convert` library. This involves using `jsonDecode()` to convert a JSON string into Dart objects (typically `Map<String, dynamic>` for JSON objects or `List<dynamic>` for JSON arrays).

While manual parsing works, it can be error-prone and verbose. However, understanding how it works is important before moving on to automated solutions. You'll learn how to access nested data, handle arrays, and work with different JSON data types.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand JSON format and how to manually parse JSON data in Dart. You'll be able to convert JSON strings into Dart objects and extract the data you need. This foundational knowledge is essential before learning more advanced serialization techniques.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):** A lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate.
*   **JSON Parsing:** The process of converting a JSON string into native programming language objects (in this case, Dart objects).
*   **`jsonDecode()`:** A function from Dart's `dart:convert` library that converts a JSON string into Dart objects (Map, List, etc.).
*   **`Map<String, dynamic>`:** A Dart map type that can hold key-value pairs where keys are strings and values can be any type (dynamic).
*   **Nested JSON:** JSON structure where objects or arrays are contained within other objects or arrays, creating a hierarchical structure.
