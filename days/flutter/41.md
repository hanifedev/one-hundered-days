# Day 41: API Integration - Introduction to HTTP Requests

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand APIs:** Learn what an API (Application Programming Interface) is and why it's essential for mobile apps.
2.  **Install HTTP Package:** Add the `http` package to your Flutter project using `pubspec.yaml`.
3.  **Explore HTTP Methods:** Understand the basic HTTP methods: GET (retrieve data), POST (send data), PUT (update), DELETE (remove).
4.  **Make Your First GET Request:** Use the `http` package to make a simple GET request to a public API (e.g., JSONPlaceholder, httpbin.org).
5.  **Handle the Response:** Print the response body to the console and understand the structure of HTTP responses.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today marks the beginning of a crucial skill in mobile development: integrating with external APIs. Most real-world applications need to fetch data from servers or send data to them. APIs are the bridges that allow your app to communicate with backend services.

The `http` package is Flutter's standard package for making HTTP requests. It's simple, well-documented, and perfect for learning. You'll start with GET requests, which are used to retrieve data from a server. GET requests are the simplest type of HTTP request—you're just asking for information.

You'll use a public API like JSONPlaceholder, which provides fake data for testing. This is perfect for learning because you don't need authentication or special setup. You'll make a request and see the response, which is typically in JSON format.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand what APIs are and how to make basic HTTP requests in Flutter. You'll be able to fetch data from external sources, which is a fundamental skill for building data-driven applications. This knowledge will enable you to build apps that can display real-time information from the internet.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **API (Application Programming Interface):** A set of protocols and tools for building software applications. In web/mobile development, it often refers to REST APIs that allow apps to communicate with servers.
*   **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):** The protocol used for transmitting data over the internet. HTTP requests are how your app communicates with servers.
*   **GET Request:** An HTTP method used to retrieve data from a server. It's read-only and doesn't modify server data.
*   **`http` Package:** A Flutter package that provides functions for making HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).
*   **Response:** The data returned by a server in response to an HTTP request, typically containing a status code, headers, and a body.
