# Day 85: Animations - Practice Project & Review

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Project Goal:** Build a complete app that showcases various animations (e.g., an interactive dashboard, a game, or a creative portfolio).
2.  **Implement Implicit Animations:** Use multiple implicit animation widgets (`AnimatedContainer`, `AnimatedOpacity`, etc.) throughout your app.
3.  **Add Hero Animations:** Implement Hero animations for smooth transitions between screens.
4.  **Create Custom Graphics (Optional):** Use `CustomPaint` to create custom visual elements if needed.
5.  **Polish Animations:** Fine-tune animation durations, curves, and timing to create smooth, polished effects.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll apply everything you've learned about animations by building a complete application that showcases various animation techniques. This project will help you understand how to use animations effectively in a real app.

Plan your animations carefully. Not every change needs to be animated—use animations to:
- Provide visual feedback for user actions
- Guide user attention
- Create smooth transitions
- Make the app feel polished and responsive

Use implicit animations for most cases—they're simple and effective. Add Hero animations for screen transitions to create visual continuity. If you need custom graphics, use `CustomPaint`.

Pay attention to animation timing. Animations that are too fast feel jarring, while animations that are too slow feel sluggish. Typically, 200-400ms is a good duration for most animations. Use appropriate curves (e.g., ease-in-out) for natural-feeling motion.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have built a complete application with various animations. You'll have practical experience in using implicit animations, Hero animations, and potentially custom graphics. This project demonstrates your ability to create polished, animated UIs that provide excellent user experience.
