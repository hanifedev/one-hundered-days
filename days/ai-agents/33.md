# Day 33: Advanced Agent Architectures - Agentic Workflows

## 📝 Today's Agenda

*   **Understanding Agentic Workflows:** Learn how to design and implement complex workflows where agents perform sequential or parallel tasks.
*   **Workflow Patterns:** Explore common workflow patterns: linear, parallel, conditional, loops, and error handling.
*   **State Management:** Learn how to manage workflow state across multiple agent steps.
*   **Workflow Orchestration:** Understand tools and frameworks for orchestrating agent workflows (Prefect, Temporal, custom solutions).
*   **Practical Exercise:** Build a multi-step agentic workflow that handles a complex business process with error handling and retries.

## 🚀 Today's Goal

To learn how to design and implement complex agentic workflows that coordinate multiple agents and steps to accomplish sophisticated tasks, with proper state management and error handling.

## 🤖 Prompt Examples

*   **Concept:** "Explain agentic workflows using the analogy of a restaurant kitchen. How do different agents (chefs) coordinate to prepare a meal?"
*   **Design:** "Design an agentic workflow for processing customer orders: receiving order, checking inventory, processing payment, and shipping. What agents and steps are needed?"
*   **Implementation:** "Show me how to implement a workflow in LangChain where an agent needs to complete three sequential tasks, with error handling if any step fails."

## 💡 Today's Dictionary

*   **Agentic Workflow:** A sequence of agent actions and decisions that accomplish a complex task, often involving multiple agents and steps.
*   **Workflow Orchestration:** The coordination and management of multiple steps in a workflow, including execution order, state management, and error handling.
*   **State Management:** The process of maintaining and updating the state (data, context) of a workflow as it progresses through multiple steps.
*   **Workflow Pattern:** A reusable design for structuring agent workflows (linear, parallel, conditional, loops).
