# Day 20: Project: Build an Advanced Agent

## 📝 Today's Agenda

*   **Project Planning:** Choose a more advanced project that combines multiple concepts from the last 10 days.
*   **Project Ideas:** 
    *   A data analysis agent that can connect to a CSV, answer questions, and also generate visualizations.
    *   A coding assistant that can read a repository and help you write documentation or tests.
    *   An agent with a long-term memory and a human-in-the-loop component for personal task management.
*   **Design and Build:** Architect and implement your chosen agent.
*   **Final Showcase:** Prepare a comprehensive demo and a short presentation on your agent's architecture and capabilities.

## 🚀 Today's Goal

To synthesize your knowledge of advanced agentic concepts by building a complex, multi-component agent that solves a meaningful problem.

## 🤖 Prompt Examples

*   **Project Design:** "Create a detailed architectural diagram for a coding assistant agent. It should include the agent's core logic, the tools it has access to, and its memory system."
*   **Showcase Prep:** "Outline a 5-minute presentation for your advanced agent. It should cover the problem, the solution, the technical challenges, and a live demo."

## 💡 Today's Dictionary

*   **Synthesis:** The combination of components or elements to form a connected whole.
*   **Architecture Diagram:** A visual representation of the structure and components of a software system.
