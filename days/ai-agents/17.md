# Day 17: Agents for Software Engineering: A Code-Aware Agent

## 📝 Today's Agenda

*   **The Rise of AI in Software Development:** How AI is changing the way we build software.
*   **Essential Tools for Code Agents:** Giving agents access to read files, write files, and run shell commands.
*   **Building a Code-Aware Agent:** An agent that can understand a codebase, answer questions about it, and suggest changes.
*   **Safety and Security:** The extreme importance of guardrails when giving an agent access to the file system and shell.
*   **Practical Exercise:** Build an agent that can read a file and write a summary of it to a new file.

## 🚀 Today's Goal

To explore the exciting world of AI agents in software engineering by building a basic agent that can interact with a local codebase, while understanding the critical safety implications.

## 🤖 Prompt Examples

*   **Brainstorming:** "What are five tasks in your daily software development workflow that could be automated by an AI agent?"
*   **Design:** "Design the prompt and toolset for an agent whose only job is to write unit tests for a given function."
*   **Safety:** "What is the single most important safety guardrail to implement for an agent that can run shell commands, and why?"

## 💡 Today's Dictionary

*   **Code-Aware Agent:** An AI agent specifically designed to understand, analyze, and interact with source code.
*   **File System Tools:** Tools that allow an agent to interact with the local file system (e.g., `read_file`, `list_directory`).
*   **Shell Tool:** A tool that allows an agent to execute shell commands, which is extremely powerful but also very dangerous.
