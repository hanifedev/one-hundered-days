# Day 58: Advanced Topics - Agent Reliability and Fault Tolerance

## 📝 Today's Agenda

*   **Reliability Patterns:** Learn patterns for building reliable agents: retries, circuit breakers, fallbacks, graceful degradation.
*   **Error Handling:** Understand comprehensive error handling strategies: error classification, recovery procedures, user communication.
*   **Fault Tolerance:** Learn how to design agents that continue operating when components fail: redundant systems, health checks.
*   **Resilience Testing:** Explore techniques for testing agent resilience: chaos engineering, failure injection, load testing.
*   **Practical Exercise:** Build a fault-tolerant agent system with proper error handling and resilience mechanisms.

## 🚀 Today's Goal

To learn how to build reliable and fault-tolerant agent systems that can handle errors gracefully and continue operating under adverse conditions.

## 🤖 Prompt Examples

*   **Reliability:** "What patterns and techniques make agents more reliable? How do you handle failures gracefully?"
*   **Error Handling:** "Design an error handling strategy for agents. How do you classify errors and decide on recovery actions?"
*   **Fault Tolerance:** "How do you design agents that are fault-tolerant? What happens when LLM APIs fail or tools are unavailable?"

## 💡 Today's Dictionary

*   **Reliability:** The ability of agent systems to perform correctly and consistently under normal and adverse conditions.
*   **Fault Tolerance:** The ability of agent systems to continue operating when components fail or errors occur.
*   **Circuit Breaker:** A pattern that prevents cascading failures by stopping requests to a failing service and providing fallback behavior.
*   **Graceful Degradation:** The ability of agents to continue providing reduced functionality when some capabilities are unavailable.
