# Day 42: Specialized Agents - Research and Analysis Agents

## 📝 Today's Agenda

*   **Research Agent Capabilities:** Learn how to build agents that can conduct research: web search, information gathering, source verification.
*   **Information Synthesis:** Understand how agents can synthesize information from multiple sources into coherent reports.
*   **Source Citation:** Learn how to implement source citation and fact-checking in research agents.
*   **Analysis Tools:** Explore tools for research agents: web search APIs, academic databases, data analysis tools.
*   **Practical Exercise:** Build a research agent that can research a topic, gather information from multiple sources, and generate a report with citations.

## 🚀 Today's Goal

To learn how to build specialized research and analysis agents that can gather information, verify sources, and synthesize findings into useful reports.

## 🤖 Prompt Examples

*   **Concept:** "Explain how an AI research agent differs from a simple web search. What additional capabilities does it need?"
*   **Design:** "Design a research agent that can investigate a topic, verify information from multiple sources, and generate a report. What tools and capabilities would it need?"
*   **Implementation:** "Show me how to build a research agent in LangChain that uses web search tools and can cite its sources in the response."

## 💡 Today's Dictionary

*   **Research Agent:** An AI agent specialized for conducting research, gathering information, and synthesizing findings.
*   **Information Synthesis:** The process of combining information from multiple sources into a coherent, comprehensive report or analysis.
*   **Source Citation:** Providing references to the sources of information used by an agent, enabling verification and transparency.
