# Day 35: Advanced Agent Architectures - Practice Project & Review

## 📝 Today's Agenda

*   **Project Goal:** Build a complex agent system using advanced architectures (hierarchical, swarm, workflow, or event-driven).
*   **Architecture Selection:** Choose and justify an advanced architecture pattern for your project.
*   **Implementation:** Implement the complete agent system with proper coordination, communication, and error handling.
*   **Testing:** Test the system with various scenarios and edge cases.
*   **Documentation:** Document the architecture, design decisions, and how the system works.

## 🚀 Today's Goal

To apply advanced agent architectures by building a complete, working system that demonstrates understanding of hierarchical, swarm, workflow, or event-driven patterns.

## 🤖 Prompt Examples

*   **Architecture:** "I want to build an agent system for managing a software development project. Which advanced architecture pattern would be best and why?"
*   **Design:** "Design a multi-agent system architecture that combines hierarchical supervision with event-driven reactivity. How would these patterns work together?"
*   **Review:** "Review my agent architecture design. What improvements would you suggest for scalability and reliability?"

## 💡 Today's Dictionary

*   **Advanced Agent Architecture:** Sophisticated patterns for organizing and coordinating multiple agents (hierarchical, swarm, workflow, event-driven).
*   **Architecture Pattern:** A reusable solution to a common design problem in agent systems.
*   **System Coordination:** The mechanisms by which multiple agents work together to achieve common goals.
*   **Architecture Documentation:** Clear documentation explaining agent system architecture, design decisions, and component interactions.
