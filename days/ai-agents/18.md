# Day 18: Agents for Data Analysis: A SQL-Querying Agent

## 📝 Today's Agenda

*   **AI for Data Insights:** How agents can democratize data analysis.
*   **Connecting to Databases:** Giving an agent the ability to connect to a SQL database.
*   **Text-to-SQL:** The process of converting a natural language question into a valid SQL query.
*   **Building a Data Analyst Agent:** An agent that can answer questions from a user by querying a database, interpreting the results, and providing a natural language answer.
*   **Practical Exercise:** Connect an agent to a sample database (e.g., SQLite) and ask it questions about the data.

## 🚀 Today's Goal

To build a powerful data analysis agent that can understand natural language questions and query a database to find the answers.

## 🤖 Prompt Examples

*   **Concept:** "Explain the main challenges in building a reliable Text-to-SQL agent."
*   **Design:** "Design the prompt for an agent that helps a non-technical user explore a database. The agent should suggest interesting questions the user could ask."
*   **Implementation:** "Show the agent's thought process for converting the question 'Who were our top 5 customers last month?' into a SQL query."

## 💡 Today's Dictionary

*   **Text-to-SQL:** The task of converting a question in natural language into a corresponding SQL query.
*   **Data Analysis:** The process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information.
*   **SQLite:** A self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine that is very convenient for local development.
