# Day 25: Agent Testing and Quality Assurance

## 📝 Today's Agenda

*   **Testing Agent Behavior:** The unique challenges of testing non-deterministic AI systems.
*   **Test Types:** Unit tests for tools, integration tests for workflows, and end-to-end tests for complete agent behavior.
*   **Evaluation Metrics:** How to measure agent performance (accuracy, latency, cost, user satisfaction).
*   **Test Data and Scenarios:** Creating comprehensive test cases that cover edge cases and failure modes.
*   **Automated Testing:** Setting up CI/CD pipelines for agent testing and continuous evaluation.

## 🚀 Today's Goal

To learn how to systematically test and evaluate AI agents to ensure they meet quality standards and perform reliably in production.

## 🤖 Prompt Examples

*   **Strategy:** "How would you test an agent that needs to handle 100 different types of user queries? What's your testing strategy?"
*   **Metrics:** "What metrics would you use to evaluate a customer support agent? How would you measure success?"
*   **Automation:** "Design an automated testing pipeline for an agent that runs on every code commit. What tests should it include?"

## 💡 Today's Dictionary

*   **Non-Deterministic:** Systems that may produce different outputs for the same input, which is common with AI models.
*   **Evaluation Metrics:** Quantitative measures used to assess the performance and quality of an AI system.
*   **CI/CD:** Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment - automated processes for testing and deploying code changes.
