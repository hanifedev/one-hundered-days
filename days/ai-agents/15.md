# Day 15: Advanced Memory: Vector Databases and RAG

## 📝 Today's Agenda

*   **Limitations of Basic Memory:** Why simple chat history is not enough for complex tasks.
*   **Introduction to Vector Embeddings:** Representing text as numerical vectors.
*   **Vector Databases:** What they are and why they are essential for long-term memory (e.g., ChromaDB, Pinecone).
*   **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** The pattern of retrieving relevant information from a vector database and adding it to the prompt context.
*   **Practical Exercise:** Build an agent that can answer questions about a large document that it has never seen before, using RAG.

## 🚀 Today's Goal

To learn how to give agents a long-term memory by using vector databases and the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern, enabling them to work with large amounts of information.

## 🤖 Prompt Examples

*   **Concept:** "Explain Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to me as if I were a librarian."
*   **Design:** "Design the memory architecture for an agent that needs to remember all of its past conversations with a user over several months."
*   **Implementation:** "Show me the basic steps in Python to take a text document, convert it to embeddings, and store it in a ChromaDB collection."

## 💡 Today's Dictionary

*   **Vector Embedding:** A numerical representation of text, images, or other data in a high-dimensional space.
*   **Vector Database:** A database specifically designed to store and query vector embeddings efficiently.
*   **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** An architecture that combines a retrieval system (like a vector database) with a generative model to produce more informed responses.
