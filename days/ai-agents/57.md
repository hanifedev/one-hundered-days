# Day 57: Advanced Topics - Agent Optimization and Efficiency

## 📝 Today's Agenda

*   **Prompt Optimization:** Learn techniques for optimizing prompts to reduce token usage and improve response quality.
*   **Model Selection:** Understand how to choose the right LLM model for different tasks: cost vs. capability trade-offs.
*   **Caching Strategies:** Explore caching strategies for agent responses: response caching, tool result caching, embedding caching.
*   **Batch Processing:** Learn how to batch agent requests to improve efficiency and reduce costs.
*   **Practical Exercise:** Optimize an agent system for efficiency, reducing costs and improving performance.

## 🚀 Today's Goal

To learn techniques for optimizing agent systems to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and maintain or improve performance.

## 🤖 Prompt Examples

*   **Optimization:** "What are the key strategies for optimizing agent systems? How do you balance cost, performance, and quality?"
*   **Prompt Engineering:** "How can you optimize prompts to reduce token usage while maintaining or improving response quality?"
*   **Caching:** "What caching strategies work best for agents? When should you cache responses, tool results, or embeddings?"

## 💡 Today's Dictionary

*   **Prompt Optimization:** Improving prompts to achieve better results with fewer tokens, reducing costs and improving efficiency.
*   **Model Selection:** Choosing the appropriate LLM model for a task based on requirements, cost, and performance trade-offs.
*   **Response Caching:** Storing and reusing agent responses for identical or similar queries to reduce API calls and costs.
*   **Batch Processing:** Processing multiple agent requests together to improve efficiency and reduce per-request overhead.
