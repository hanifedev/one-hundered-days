# Day 11: Advanced Tool Use: Dynamic Tools and Error Handling

## 📝 Today's Agenda

*   **Review of Basic Tool Use:** Briefly recap how agents use tools.
*   **Dynamic Tool Creation:** Creating tools on the fly based on context.
*   **Tool Routing:** Building agents that can decide which tool to use from a large set.
*   **Error Handling:** What should an agent do when a tool fails or returns an error?
*   **Practical Exercise:** Build an agent that can handle a failing API gracefully.

## 🚀 Today's Goal

To move beyond basic tool use and build agents that can dynamically choose the right tool for the job and are resilient to tool-related errors.

## 🤖 Prompt Examples

*   **Concept:** "Explain the concept of a 'tool router' in an AI agent as you would to a junior developer."
*   **Design:** "Design an error handling strategy for an agent that uses a weather API which sometimes goes offline."
*   **Implementation:** "Show me a code snippet for an agent that dynamically creates a tool to search for information on a specific website."

## 💡 Today's Dictionary

*   **Dynamic Tool:** A tool that is created or configured at runtime, rather than being predefined.
*   **Router Agent:** An agent that specializes in selecting the appropriate tool or next agent to call based on the user's query.
*   **Resilience:** The ability of a system to handle errors and continue functioning.
