# Day 52: Enterprise Integration - Authentication and Authorization

## 📝 Today's Agenda

*   **Agent Authentication:** Learn how to implement authentication for agent APIs: API keys, OAuth, JWT tokens.
*   **Authorization Models:** Understand authorization models for agents: role-based access control (RBAC), attribute-based access control (ABAC).
*   **Multi-Tenancy:** Learn how to support multiple tenants (organizations, users) in agent systems with proper isolation.
*   **Audit Logging:** Understand how to implement audit logging for agent actions to meet compliance requirements.
*   **Practical Exercise:** Implement authentication, authorization, and audit logging for an agent system.

## 🚀 Today's Goal

To learn how to implement proper authentication, authorization, and audit logging for agent systems, ensuring security and compliance in enterprise environments.

## 🤖 Prompt Examples

*   **Security:** "What authentication and authorization mechanisms are best for agent APIs in an enterprise? How do you handle multi-tenancy?"
*   **Design:** "Design an authorization system for agents where different users have different permissions for different agent capabilities."
*   **Compliance:** "How would you implement audit logging for agent actions to meet compliance requirements like SOC 2 or GDPR?"

## 💡 Today's Dictionary

*   **Authentication:** Verifying the identity of users or systems accessing agent services (who you are).
*   **Authorization:** Determining what actions authenticated users or systems are allowed to perform (what you can do).
*   **Multi-Tenancy:** Supporting multiple isolated tenants (organizations, users) in a single agent system.
*   **Audit Logging:** Recording all agent actions and access for compliance, security, and debugging purposes.
