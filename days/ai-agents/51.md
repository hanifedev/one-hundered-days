# Day 51: Enterprise Integration - Agent APIs and Microservices

## 📝 Today's Agenda

*   **Microservices Architecture:** Learn how to design agents as microservices that can be integrated into larger enterprise systems.
*   **API Design Patterns:** Understand enterprise API design patterns: REST, GraphQL, gRPC, message queues.
*   **Service Integration:** Learn how agents integrate with enterprise systems: databases, message brokers, authentication systems.
*   **API Gateway:** Understand how to use API gateways for agent services: routing, rate limiting, authentication, monitoring.
*   **Practical Exercise:** Build an agent microservice with proper API design and integrate it with other enterprise services.

## 🚀 Today's Goal

To learn how to design and implement agents as enterprise microservices with proper API design, enabling integration with larger enterprise systems and architectures.

## 🤖 Prompt Examples

*   **Architecture:** "Design an agent microservice architecture for an enterprise. How would agents integrate with existing systems and services?"
*   **API Design:** "What API design patterns are best for agent services in an enterprise? REST, GraphQL, or message queues?"
*   **Integration:** "Show me how to integrate an agent service with an enterprise message broker (Kafka, RabbitMQ) for event-driven workflows."

## 💡 Today's Dictionary

*   **Microservices Architecture:** An architectural approach where applications are built as a collection of small, independent services (like agent services).
*   **API Gateway:** A service that acts as a single entry point for multiple microservices, handling routing, authentication, and rate limiting.
*   **Enterprise Integration:** Connecting agent services with existing enterprise systems (databases, message brokers, authentication, etc.).
*   **Service Mesh:** An infrastructure layer for managing service-to-service communication in microservices architectures.
