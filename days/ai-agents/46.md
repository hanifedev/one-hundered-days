# Day 46: Advanced Topics - Agent Reasoning and Planning

## 📝 Today's Agenda

*   **Advanced Reasoning:** Learn about advanced reasoning techniques for agents: chain-of-thought, tree-of-thoughts, self-consistency.
*   **Planning Algorithms:** Explore planning algorithms for agents: hierarchical planning, partial-order planning, replanning.
*   **Uncertainty Handling:** Understand how agents can handle uncertainty and make decisions under incomplete information.
*   **Meta-Reasoning:** Learn about agents that can reason about their own reasoning process and improve over time.
*   **Practical Exercise:** Implement an agent with advanced reasoning capabilities that can plan complex, multi-step tasks.

## 🚀 Today's Goal

To understand and implement advanced reasoning and planning capabilities in agents, enabling them to handle complex, uncertain, and multi-step tasks more effectively.

## 🤖 Prompt Examples

*   **Concept:** "Explain the difference between chain-of-thought and tree-of-thoughts reasoning. When would you use each?"
*   **Design:** "Design an agent that needs to plan a complex project with multiple steps and dependencies. What planning approach would you use?"
*   **Implementation:** "Show me how to implement tree-of-thoughts reasoning in a LangChain agent for solving complex problems that require exploration of multiple solution paths."

## 💡 Today's Dictionary

*   **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:** A reasoning technique where an agent breaks down a problem into a series of intermediate reasoning steps.
*   **Tree-of-Thoughts:** A reasoning technique where an agent explores multiple reasoning paths (branches) to find the best solution.
*   **Planning Algorithm:** An algorithm that determines a sequence of actions to achieve a goal, considering constraints and dependencies.
*   **Meta-Reasoning:** The ability of an agent to reason about its own reasoning process, enabling self-improvement and adaptation.
