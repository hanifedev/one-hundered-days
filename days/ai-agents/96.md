# Day 96: Final Projects - Comprehensive Agent System (Part 1)

## 📝 Today's Agenda

*   **Project Planning:** Plan a comprehensive, production-ready agent system that incorporates all concepts learned over 96 days.
*   **Architecture Design:** Design complete system architecture: agents, tools, memory, monitoring, security, deployment.
*   **Technology Selection:** Select appropriate technologies: frameworks, LLMs, databases, infrastructure, deployment platforms.
*   **Implementation Start:** Begin implementing core components of your comprehensive agent system.
*   **Documentation:** Start documenting your system: architecture, design decisions, implementation plan.

## 🚀 Today's Goal

To begin building a comprehensive, production-ready agent system that demonstrates mastery of all agent development concepts.
