# Day 22: Multi-Modal Agents: Vision and Audio

## 📝 Today's Agenda

*   **Beyond Text:** Expanding agent capabilities to understand images, audio, and video.
*   **Vision Models:** Integrating vision-language models (VLMs) to enable agents to analyze images, screenshots, and visual data.
*   **Audio Processing:** Giving agents the ability to transcribe, understand, and generate audio content.
*   **Multi-Modal Tool Integration:** Building agents that can seamlessly switch between text, vision, and audio modalities.
*   **Practical Exercise:** Build an agent that can analyze an image and generate a detailed description, or an agent that can process audio input.

## 🚀 Today's Goal

To explore how to build agents that can process and understand multiple types of input beyond just text, opening up new possibilities for agent applications.

## 🤖 Prompt Examples

*   **Vision:** "Design an agent that can analyze a screenshot of a website and provide feedback on its UI/UX. What tools and models would it need?"
*   **Audio:** "How would you build an agent that can listen to a meeting recording and generate a summary with action items?"
*   **Integration:** "What are the main challenges in building a truly multi-modal agent that can seamlessly work with text, images, and audio?"

## 💡 Today's Dictionary

*   **Multi-Modal:** The ability to process and understand multiple types of input (text, images, audio, video).
*   **Vision-Language Model (VLM):** A model that can understand both visual and textual information.
*   **Transcription:** The process of converting spoken audio into written text.
