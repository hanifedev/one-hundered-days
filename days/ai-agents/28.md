# Day 28: Agent Performance Optimization

## 📝 Today's Agenda

*   **Performance Bottlenecks:** Identifying common performance issues in agents (slow API calls, inefficient prompts, unnecessary tool calls).
*   **Latency Optimization:** Strategies for reducing response time (parallel execution, async operations, model selection).
*   **Throughput Optimization:** Techniques for handling more requests per second (batching, connection pooling, load balancing).
*   **Resource Management:** Efficient use of memory, CPU, and network resources.
*   **Profiling and Benchmarking:** Tools and techniques for measuring and improving agent performance.

## 🚀 Today's Goal

To learn how to identify and fix performance bottlenecks in AI agents, ensuring they can handle production workloads efficiently.

## 🤖 Prompt Examples

*   **Analysis:** "An agent takes 10 seconds to respond. How would you profile it to identify the bottleneck?"
*   **Optimization:** "An agent needs to process 1000 requests per minute. What optimization strategies would you implement?"
*   **Trade-offs:** "What are the trade-offs between optimizing for latency versus optimizing for cost in an agent system?"

## 💡 Today's Dictionary

*   **Latency:** The time delay between a request and its response.
*   **Throughput:** The number of requests or operations that can be processed in a given time period.
*   **Profiling:** The process of analyzing a program's execution to identify performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities.
