# Day 59: Advanced Topics - Agent Evaluation and Benchmarking

## 📝 Today's Agenda

*   **Evaluation Frameworks:** Learn about frameworks for evaluating agents: HELM, AgentBench, custom evaluation suites.
*   **Benchmarking:** Understand how to benchmark agent performance: latency, accuracy, cost, reliability metrics.
*   **A/B Testing:** Learn how to conduct A/B tests for agents: comparing different models, prompts, or architectures.
*   **Continuous Evaluation:** Explore strategies for continuously evaluating agents in production: monitoring, feedback loops, automated testing.
*   **Practical Exercise:** Set up a comprehensive evaluation and benchmarking system for agents.

## 🚀 Today's Goal

To learn how to systematically evaluate and benchmark agents, enabling data-driven decisions about agent performance and improvements.

## 🤖 Prompt Examples

*   **Evaluation:** "How do you evaluate agent performance? What metrics and frameworks are most useful?"
*   **Benchmarking:** "Design a benchmarking strategy for agents. What tasks and metrics would you use to compare different agent implementations?"
*   **A/B Testing:** "How do you conduct A/B tests for agents? What are the challenges and how do you measure success?"

## 💡 Today's Dictionary

*   **Agent Evaluation:** The systematic assessment of agent performance using metrics, tests, and benchmarks.
*   **Benchmarking:** Comparing agent performance against standard tasks or other agents to measure relative performance.
*   **A/B Testing:** Comparing two versions of an agent (different models, prompts, or architectures) to determine which performs better.
*   **Evaluation Framework:** A structured approach and set of tools for evaluating agent performance across different dimensions.
