# Day 23: Agent Security and Privacy

## 📝 Today's Agenda

*   **Security Threats to Agents:** Understanding the unique security challenges that AI agents face (prompt injection, data leakage, unauthorized tool use).
*   **Prompt Injection Attacks:** How malicious inputs can manipulate agent behavior and how to defend against them.
*   **Data Privacy:** Ensuring sensitive data is handled appropriately and not exposed in prompts or logs.
*   **Access Control:** Implementing proper authentication and authorization for agent tools and resources.
*   **Best Practices:** Security guidelines for building production-ready agents.

## 🚀 Today's Goal

To understand the critical security and privacy considerations when building AI agents and learn how to implement proper safeguards.

## 🤖 Prompt Examples

*   **Threats:** "What is a prompt injection attack, and what are three ways to defend against it?"
*   **Privacy:** "An agent needs to process customer data. What are the key privacy considerations you need to address?"
*   **Design:** "Design a secure agent architecture that can safely handle user inputs while preventing unauthorized access to sensitive tools."

## 💡 Today's Dictionary

*   **Prompt Injection:** A security attack where malicious input is crafted to manipulate an AI agent's behavior or extract sensitive information.
*   **Data Leakage:** The unintended exposure of sensitive or private information through logs, error messages, or agent responses.
*   **Access Control:** The process of ensuring that only authorized users or systems can access specific resources or perform certain actions.
