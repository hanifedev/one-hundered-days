# Day 79: Specialized Agents - IoT and Edge Agents

## 📝 Today's Agenda

*   **IoT Use Cases:** Learn about agent applications in IoT: smart home automation, industrial monitoring, sensor data analysis.
*   **Edge Computing:** Understand edge computing for agents: running agents on edge devices, reduced latency, offline capability.
*   **Resource Constraints:** Learn how to optimize agents for resource-constrained devices: model compression, efficient inference.
*   **Real-Time Processing:** Explore real-time agent processing for IoT: streaming data, event-driven responses, low latency.
*   **Practical Exercise:** Design an IoT agent system that processes sensor data and triggers actions in real-time.

## 🚀 Today's Goal

To understand how to build agents for IoT and edge computing environments, handling resource constraints and real-time requirements.

## 🤖 Prompt Examples

*   **IoT Applications:** "What are effective agent applications in IoT? How do agents work with sensors and actuators?"
*   **Edge Computing:** "How do you deploy agents to edge devices? What are the challenges and optimization strategies?"
*   **Real-Time:** "Design an agent system for IoT that processes sensor data in real-time and triggers actions. What architecture would you use?"

## 💡 Today's Dictionary

*   **IoT Agent:** An AI agent designed for Internet of Things applications, often running on edge devices with resource constraints.
*   **Edge Computing:** Running agents on edge devices (close to data sources) rather than in the cloud, reducing latency and enabling offline operation.
*   **Resource Constraints:** Limitations in edge devices (CPU, memory, power) that require optimization of agent models and inference.
*   **Real-Time Processing:** Processing data and making decisions immediately as events occur, critical for many IoT applications.
