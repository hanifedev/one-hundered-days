# Day 34: Advanced Agent Architectures - Event-Driven Agents

## 📝 Today's Agenda

*   **Event-Driven Architecture:** Learn how agents can respond to events and trigger actions based on system events.
*   **Event Sources:** Understand different event sources: user actions, system events, external APIs, scheduled events.
*   **Event Processing:** Learn how agents process events: filtering, transformation, routing, aggregation.
*   **Reactive Agents:** Explore how agents can be designed to react to events in real-time.
*   **Practical Exercise:** Build an event-driven agent system that monitors events and triggers appropriate agent actions.

## 🚀 Today's Goal

To understand event-driven agent architectures and learn how to build agents that react to events in real-time, enabling responsive and reactive agent systems.

## 🤖 Prompt Examples

*   **Concept:** "Explain event-driven agents using the example of a security system that reacts to different types of alarms."
*   **Design:** "Design an event-driven agent system for monitoring application logs. What events would trigger agent actions, and what would those actions be?"
*   **Implementation:** "Show me how to build an agent in LangChain that listens to events from a message queue and processes them reactively."

## 💡 Today's Dictionary

*   **Event-Driven Architecture:** An architectural pattern where agents respond to events (occurrences, changes) rather than polling or scheduled execution.
*   **Event Source:** A system or component that generates events that agents can react to (user actions, APIs, sensors, etc.).
*   **Reactive Agent:** An agent that responds to events in real-time, triggering actions based on event types and content.
*   **Event Processing:** The handling of events by agents, including filtering, transformation, routing, and action triggering.
