# Day 36: Production Deployment - Containerization and Orchestration

## 📝 Today's Agenda

*   **Containerizing Agents:** Learn how to containerize AI agents using Docker for consistent deployment.
*   **Agent Dependencies:** Understand how to manage agent dependencies (LLMs, vector databases, tools) in containers.
*   **Orchestration:** Explore container orchestration for agents (Kubernetes, Docker Compose) for scaling and management.
*   **Environment Configuration:** Learn best practices for managing environment variables, API keys, and configuration in production.
*   **Practical Exercise:** Containerize an agent application and deploy it using Docker Compose or Kubernetes.

## 🚀 Today's Goal

To learn how to containerize and orchestrate AI agents for production deployment, enabling scalable, reliable agent deployments.

## 🤖 Prompt Examples

*   **Concept:** "Explain why containerizing AI agents is important for production deployment. What challenges does it solve?"
*   **Design:** "Design a Docker setup for an agent that uses OpenAI API, a vector database, and custom tools. What would the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml look like?"
*   **Implementation:** "Show me how to create a Dockerfile for a LangChain agent application that needs to access external APIs and a vector database."

## 💡 Today's Dictionary

*   **Containerization:** Packaging an application and its dependencies into a container (Docker) for consistent deployment across environments.
*   **Container Orchestration:** Managing multiple containers (starting, stopping, scaling, networking) using tools like Kubernetes or Docker Compose.
*   **Dockerfile:** A file that defines how to build a Docker container image for an application.
*   **Production Deployment:** Deploying an application to a production environment where it serves real users.
