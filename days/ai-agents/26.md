# Day 26: Agent Communication Protocols

## 📝 Today's Agenda

*   **Inter-Agent Communication:** How agents can communicate and coordinate with each other.
*   **Communication Patterns:** Message passing, shared state, event-driven communication, and publish-subscribe patterns.
*   **Protocols and Standards:** Understanding different approaches to agent communication (custom protocols, REST APIs, WebSockets, message queues).
*   **Building a Multi-Agent System:** Creating a system where multiple specialized agents work together to solve complex problems.
*   **Practical Exercise:** Build a simple multi-agent system where agents communicate to complete a collaborative task.

## 🚀 Today's Goal

To understand how to design and implement communication protocols that enable multiple agents to work together effectively.

## 🤖 Prompt Examples

*   **Design:** "Design a communication protocol for three agents: a research agent, an analysis agent, and a report-writing agent. How should they coordinate?"
*   **Architecture:** "What are the pros and cons of using a message queue versus direct API calls for agent communication?"
*   **Coordination:** "How would you handle a situation where two agents need to work on the same task simultaneously?"

## 💡 Today's Dictionary

*   **Protocol:** A set of rules and conventions that define how agents communicate and exchange information.
*   **Message Queue:** A communication mechanism that allows agents to send and receive messages asynchronously.
*   **Publish-Subscribe (Pub/Sub):** A messaging pattern where agents can publish messages to topics and subscribe to receive messages from topics of interest.
