# Day 29: Open Source Agent Frameworks Deep Dive

## 📝 Today's Agenda

*   **Framework Comparison:** Deep dive into popular open-source agent frameworks (LangChain, LlamaIndex, AutoGen, CrewAI, etc.).
*   **Framework Architecture:** Understanding how different frameworks structure agents, tools, and memory.
*   **Choosing the Right Framework:** Criteria for selecting a framework based on your use case, requirements, and constraints.
*   **Framework Customization:** How to extend and customize frameworks to meet specific needs.
*   **Community and Ecosystem:** Exploring the communities, plugins, and integrations available for each framework.

## 🚀 Today's Goal

To gain deep understanding of the major open-source agent frameworks, their strengths and weaknesses, and how to choose and work with them effectively.

## 🤖 Prompt Examples

*   **Comparison:** "Compare LangChain and LlamaIndex for building a RAG-based agent. What are the key differences?"
*   **Selection:** "You need to build a multi-agent system with complex workflows. Which framework would you choose and why?"
*   **Customization:** "How would you extend a framework like LangChain to add custom tool types that aren't supported out of the box?"

## 💡 Today's Dictionary

*   **Framework:** A reusable software platform that provides a foundation and structure for building applications.
*   **Ecosystem:** The collection of tools, libraries, plugins, and community resources that support a framework.
*   **Customization:** The process of modifying or extending a framework to meet specific requirements beyond its default capabilities.
