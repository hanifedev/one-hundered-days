# Day 14: Introduction to Fine-Tuning for Agentic Behavior

## 📝 Today's Agenda

*   **What is Fine-Tuning?** Understanding the difference between prompting and fine-tuning a model.
*   **Why Fine-Tune for Agents?** How fine-tuning can improve an agent's reasoning, tool use, and adherence to instructions.
*   **Preparing a Dataset:** How to collect and structure data for fine-tuning (e.g., instruction-response pairs).
*   **The Fine-Tuning Process:** A high-level overview of the steps involved in fine-tuning an open-source LLM.
*   **Discussion:** When does it make sense to fine-tune versus using more advanced prompting techniques?

## 🚀 Today's Goal

To understand the fundamentals of fine-tuning Large Language Models and how this process can be used to create more effective and reliable AI agents.

## 🤖 Prompt Examples

*   **Concept:** "Explain the difference between zero-shot prompting, few-shot prompting, and fine-tuning."
*   **Data Prep:** "I want to fine-tune an agent to be better at using my company's internal API. What kind of data should I create for the training dataset?"
*   **Strategy:** "Is fine-tuning a good solution for teaching an agent new knowledge, or is there a better way?"

## 💡 Today's Dictionary

*   **Fine-Tuning:** The process of taking a pre-trained language model and further training it on a smaller, task-specific dataset.
*   **Pre-trained Model:** A model that has been trained on a massive dataset and can be adapted for various tasks.
*   **Dataset:** A collection of data used for training or evaluating a model.
