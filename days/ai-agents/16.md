# Day 16: Advanced Planning: Task Decomposition with Tree of Thoughts

## 📝 Today's Agenda

*   **Limitations of Simple Planners:** Why ReAct struggles with complex, multi-step problems.
*   **Introduction to Planning:** The concept of exploring different paths to a solution.
*   **Tree of Thoughts (ToT):** A framework that allows an agent to explore multiple reasoning paths in parallel, like a tree.
*   **Graph of Thoughts (GoT):** An even more advanced concept where reasoning paths can merge and loop.
*   **Discussion:** Compare the pros and cons of ReAct, ToT, and other planning algorithms.

## 🚀 Today's Goal

To understand more advanced planning and task decomposition techniques that allow agents to tackle complex problems requiring foresight and exploration of multiple solutions.

## 🤖 Prompt Examples

*   **Concept:** "Use an analogy to explain the difference between the ReAct framework and the Tree of Thoughts framework."
*   **Problem Solving:** "How would a Tree of Thoughts agent approach the problem of 'planning a 3-day trip to a new city'?"
*   **Analysis:** "What are the main challenges in implementing a Tree of Thoughts planner?"

## 💡 Today's Dictionary

*   **Task Decomposition:** The process of breaking down a large, complex task into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks.
*   **Planner:** The component of an agent responsible for creating a sequence of actions to achieve a goal.
*   **Tree of Thoughts (ToT):** An advanced planning framework where an agent explores multiple branches of reasoning simultaneously.
