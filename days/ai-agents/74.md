# Day 74: Advanced Patterns - Hybrid Human-AI Agents

## 📝 Today's Agenda

*   **Human-AI Collaboration:** Learn about hybrid systems where humans and agents work together: human-in-the-loop, collaborative workflows.
*   **Task Allocation:** Understand how to allocate tasks between humans and agents: complexity-based, confidence-based, cost-based.
*   **Seamless Handoff:** Learn how to implement seamless handoffs between humans and agents: context preservation, state management.
*   **Augmented Intelligence:** Explore how agents augment human capabilities rather than replace them.
*   **Practical Exercise:** Build a hybrid human-AI agent system where humans and agents collaborate on tasks.

## 🚀 Today's Goal

To understand how to build hybrid systems where humans and agents collaborate effectively, leveraging the strengths of both.

## 🤖 Prompt Examples

*   **Collaboration:** "How do you design systems where humans and agents work together? What are effective collaboration patterns?"
*   **Allocation:** "How do you decide whether a task should be handled by a human or an agent? What criteria would you use?"
*   **Handoff:** "Design a system for seamless handoffs between humans and agents. How would you preserve context and ensure smooth transitions?"

## 💡 Today's Dictionary

*   **Human-AI Collaboration:** Systems where humans and AI agents work together, each contributing their unique strengths.
*   **Human-in-the-Loop:** A pattern where humans are involved in agent workflows, providing oversight, validation, or handling complex cases.
*   **Task Allocation:** The process of deciding which tasks are handled by humans versus agents based on various criteria.
*   **Augmented Intelligence:** Using AI agents to enhance human capabilities rather than replace human judgment and expertise.
