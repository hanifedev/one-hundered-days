# Day 84: Production Excellence - Advanced Security Hardening

## 📝 Today's Agenda

*   **Security Threats:** Learn about security threats specific to agents: prompt injection, data leakage, model poisoning, API key theft.
*   **Defense Mechanisms:** Understand defense mechanisms: input sanitization, output filtering, rate limiting, access controls.
*   **Security Architecture:** Design secure agent architectures: network isolation, encryption, secure key management, audit logging.
*   **Penetration Testing:** Learn how to conduct security testing for agents: vulnerability scanning, red team exercises, security audits.
*   **Practical Exercise:** Implement comprehensive security hardening for an agent system and conduct security testing.

## 🚀 Today's Goal

To implement advanced security hardening for agent systems, protecting against threats and ensuring secure operation in production.

## 🤖 Prompt Examples

*   **Security Threats:** "What are the main security threats for agent systems? How do you defend against prompt injection and data leakage?"
*   **Defense:** "Design a security architecture for agents. What layers of defense would you implement?"
*   **Testing:** "How do you test agent security? What security testing approaches are most effective for agents?"

## 💡 Today's Dictionary

*   **Security Hardening:** Strengthening agent systems against security threats through multiple layers of defense and best practices.
*   **Prompt Injection:** A security attack where malicious input manipulates agent behavior or extracts sensitive information.
*   **Security Architecture:** The design of agent systems with security built in, including isolation, encryption, and access controls.
*   **Penetration Testing:** Security testing that simulates attacks to identify vulnerabilities before malicious actors can exploit them.
