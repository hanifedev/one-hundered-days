# Day 19: Deploying and Monitoring AI Agents

## 📝 Today's Agenda

*   **From Prototype to Production:** What it takes to deploy an agent.
*   **Deployment Strategies:** Packaging your agent as a web service or API (e.g., using FastAPI or NestJS).
*   **Monitoring Key Metrics:** Tracking performance, cost, latency, and the quality of the agent's responses.
*   **Logging and Tracing:** Using tools like LangSmith to get visibility into your agent's decision-making process.
*   **Continuous Improvement:** Setting up a feedback loop to collect user feedback and improve the agent over time.

## 🚀 Today's Goal

To understand the practical steps involved in deploying an AI agent into a production environment and monitoring its performance and behavior.

## 🤖 Prompt Examples

*   **Strategy:** "What are the pros and cons of deploying an agent as a serverless function versus a long-running container?"
*   **Monitoring:** "What are the top 3 most important metrics to monitor for an AI agent that provides customer support?"
*   **Debugging:** "An agent in production is failing, but you can't reproduce the error locally. How would you use tracing to debug the issue?"

## 💡 Today's Dictionary

*   **Deployment:** The process of making an application or system available for use.
*   **Monitoring:** The process of observing a system to check for its health and performance.
*   **Tracing:** The process of tracking the execution path of a request as it flows through the components of a system, which is especially useful for debugging complex agent behaviors.
