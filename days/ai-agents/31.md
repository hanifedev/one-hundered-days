# Day 31: Advanced Agent Architectures - Hierarchical Agents

## 📝 Today's Agenda

*   **Understanding Hierarchical Agents:** Learn how agents can be organized in hierarchies with supervisor and worker agents.
*   **Supervisor Pattern:** Explore the supervisor-agent pattern where a supervisor agent delegates tasks to specialized worker agents.
*   **Task Decomposition:** Learn how hierarchical agents break down complex tasks into subtasks for worker agents.
*   **Communication Patterns:** Understand how supervisor and worker agents communicate and coordinate.
*   **Practical Exercise:** Build a hierarchical agent system with a supervisor that manages multiple specialized worker agents.

## 🚀 Today's Goal

To understand and implement hierarchical agent architectures where agents are organized in layers, with supervisor agents coordinating worker agents to handle complex, multi-step tasks.

## 🤖 Prompt Examples

*   **Concept:** "Explain hierarchical agent architecture using the analogy of a company with managers and employees."
*   **Design:** "Design a hierarchical agent system for a customer service application. What would the supervisor do, and what specialized worker agents would you need?"
*   **Implementation:** "Show me how to implement a supervisor agent in LangChain that can delegate tasks to different worker agents based on the task type."

## 💡 Today's Dictionary

*   **Hierarchical Agent:** An agent architecture where agents are organized in layers, with higher-level agents (supervisors) managing lower-level agents (workers).
*   **Supervisor Agent:** An agent that receives tasks, decomposes them, and delegates subtasks to specialized worker agents.
*   **Worker Agent:** A specialized agent that performs specific tasks delegated by a supervisor agent.
*   **Task Decomposition:** The process of breaking down a complex task into smaller, manageable subtasks.
