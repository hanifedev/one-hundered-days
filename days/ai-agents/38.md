# Day 38: Production Deployment - Monitoring and Observability

## 📝 Today's Agenda

*   **Agent Monitoring:** Learn what to monitor in production agent systems: latency, token usage, error rates, cost, user satisfaction.
*   **Logging Strategies:** Understand how to implement comprehensive logging for agents: conversation logs, decision logs, error logs.
*   **Metrics and Dashboards:** Set up metrics collection and dashboards for monitoring agent performance and health.
*   **Alerting:** Configure alerts for critical issues: high error rates, cost overruns, service degradation.
*   **Practical Exercise:** Set up monitoring, logging, and alerting for a deployed agent system.

## 🚀 Today's Goal

To learn how to monitor and observe agent systems in production, enabling you to track performance, debug issues, and ensure reliability.

## 🤖 Prompt Examples

*   **Concept:** "What metrics are most important to monitor for a production AI agent system? Why is each one important?"
*   **Design:** "Design a monitoring strategy for an agent that processes customer support tickets. What would you monitor and how would you alert on issues?"
*   **Implementation:** "Show me how to add logging and metrics collection to a LangChain agent using Python's logging library and a metrics service."

## 💡 Today's Dictionary

*   **Agent Monitoring:** Tracking the performance, health, and behavior of agent systems in production to ensure reliability and identify issues.
*   **Observability:** The ability to understand system behavior through metrics, logs, and traces, enabling debugging and optimization.
*   **Token Usage:** The number of tokens consumed by LLM API calls, directly related to cost in most LLM services.
*   **Agent Metrics:** Quantitative measurements of agent performance (latency, success rate, cost, user satisfaction).
