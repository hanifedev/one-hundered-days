# Day 73: Advanced Patterns - Meta-Agents and Agent Orchestration

## 📝 Today's Agenda

*   **Meta-Agents:** Learn about agents that manage other agents: agent supervisors, orchestrators, coordinators.
*   **Orchestration Patterns:** Explore patterns for orchestrating multiple agents: workflow orchestration, dynamic routing, load balancing.
*   **Agent Selection:** Understand how meta-agents select the right agent for a task: capability matching, performance prediction.
*   **Resource Management:** Learn how meta-agents manage resources: token budgets, API rate limits, cost allocation.
*   **Practical Exercise:** Build a meta-agent that orchestrates multiple specialized agents to handle complex, multi-step tasks.

## 🚀 Today's Goal

To understand meta-agents and learn how to build agent orchestration systems that manage and coordinate multiple agents effectively.

## 🤖 Prompt Examples

*   **Meta-Agents:** "What are meta-agents? How do they differ from regular agents, and when would you use them?"
*   **Orchestration:** "Design an agent orchestration system that manages multiple specialized agents. How would it route tasks and coordinate workflows?"
*   **Selection:** "How would a meta-agent decide which agent to use for a given task? What criteria and mechanisms would it use?"

## 💡 Today's Dictionary

*   **Meta-Agent:** An agent that manages, orchestrates, or coordinates other agents rather than performing tasks directly.
*   **Agent Orchestration:** The coordination and management of multiple agents to accomplish complex tasks that require multiple agents.
*   **Agent Selection:** The process of choosing the most appropriate agent for a task based on capabilities, performance, and availability.
*   **Resource Management:** Allocating and managing resources (tokens, API calls, costs) across multiple agents in an orchestration system.
