# Day 71: Advanced Patterns - Self-Improving Agents

## 📝 Today's Agenda

*   **Self-Improvement Concepts:** Learn how agents can improve themselves: prompt optimization, strategy refinement, error learning.
*   **Feedback Integration:** Understand how agents can integrate feedback to improve: user feedback, outcome feedback, performance metrics.
*   **Meta-Learning:** Explore meta-learning approaches where agents learn how to learn and adapt their strategies.
*   **Continuous Optimization:** Learn how to implement continuous optimization loops for agents.
*   **Practical Exercise:** Build an agent that can improve its performance over time through feedback and self-optimization.

## 🚀 Today's Goal

To understand and implement self-improving agents that can learn from experience and continuously optimize their performance.

## 🤖 Prompt Examples

*   **Concept:** "How can agents improve themselves? What mechanisms enable self-improvement and continuous learning?"
*   **Design:** "Design a self-improving agent system. How would it collect feedback, analyze performance, and update its strategies?"
*   **Implementation:** "Show me how to implement a feedback loop in an agent that allows it to learn from outcomes and improve its prompts or strategies."

## 💡 Today's Dictionary

*   **Self-Improving Agent:** An agent that can learn from experience and continuously optimize its performance, strategies, or prompts.
*   **Meta-Learning:** Learning how to learn, enabling agents to adapt their learning strategies based on experience.
*   **Feedback Loop:** A mechanism where agents receive feedback (from users, outcomes, or metrics) and use it to improve future performance.
*   **Continuous Optimization:** The ongoing process of improving agent performance through iterative refinement based on feedback and metrics.
