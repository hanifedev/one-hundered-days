# Day 72: Advanced Patterns - Adversarial Agents

## 📝 Today's Agenda

*   **Adversarial Scenarios:** Learn about adversarial agent scenarios: red teaming, security testing, competitive environments.
*   **Defensive Agents:** Understand how to build agents that are resilient to adversarial inputs: input validation, prompt injection defense.
*   **Red Team Agents:** Explore how to build agents that test other agents for vulnerabilities and weaknesses.
*   **Competitive Agents:** Learn about agents that compete with each other: game-playing agents, auction agents, negotiation agents.
*   **Practical Exercise:** Build an adversarial agent scenario: either a defensive agent or a red team agent for testing.

## 🚀 Today's Goal

To understand adversarial agent scenarios and learn how to build agents that are resilient to attacks or that can test other agents for vulnerabilities.

## 🤖 Prompt Examples

*   **Adversarial:** "What are adversarial scenarios for agents? How do you build agents that are resilient to attacks or manipulation?"
*   **Defense:** "How do you defend agents against prompt injection and other adversarial attacks? What techniques are most effective?"
*   **Red Teaming:** "How would you build a red team agent that tests other agents for vulnerabilities and security issues?"

## 💡 Today's Dictionary

*   **Adversarial Agent:** An agent designed to test, attack, or compete with other agents, or an agent designed to be resilient to such attacks.
*   **Red Teaming:** Using adversarial agents to test systems for vulnerabilities and weaknesses before malicious actors can exploit them.
*   **Prompt Injection:** An attack where malicious input is crafted to manipulate an agent's behavior or extract information.
*   **Defensive Agent:** An agent designed with security measures to resist adversarial attacks and manipulation.
