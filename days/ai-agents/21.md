# Day 21: Agent Orchestration and Workflow Management

## 📝 Today's Agenda

*   **Complex Agent Workflows:** Understanding how to coordinate multiple agents or multiple steps in a single agent's workflow.
*   **Orchestration Patterns:** Sequential workflows, parallel execution, conditional branching, and loops.
*   **State Management Across Steps:** How to maintain context and pass information between different stages of an agent workflow.
*   **Error Handling in Workflows:** Strategies for handling failures at different stages and implementing retry logic.
*   **Practical Exercise:** Build a multi-step agent workflow that performs a complex task (e.g., research → analysis → report generation).

## 🚀 Today's Goal

To master the art of orchestrating complex agent workflows that can handle multi-step tasks with proper state management and error handling.

## 🤖 Prompt Examples

*   **Design:** "Design a workflow for an agent that needs to: 1) Search for information, 2) Validate the information, 3) Format it, and 4) Send it via email. What are the key decision points?"
*   **Error Handling:** "An agent workflow fails at step 3 of 5. What are the different strategies you could use to handle this failure?"
*   **Optimization:** "How would you optimize a workflow that has 10 sequential steps, where each step depends on the previous one?"

## 💡 Today's Dictionary

*   **Orchestration:** The coordination and management of multiple tasks or agents to achieve a complex goal.
*   **Workflow:** A sequence of connected steps or tasks that accomplish a specific objective.
*   **State Management:** The process of maintaining and updating information (state) as a workflow progresses through its steps.
