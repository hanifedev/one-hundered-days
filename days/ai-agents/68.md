# Day 68: Research & Innovation - Experimental Agent Architectures

## 📝 Today's Agenda

*   **Experimental Patterns:** Explore experimental agent architectures: self-modifying agents, meta-learning agents, evolutionary agents.
*   **Research Prototypes:** Learn how to build research prototypes to test new agent ideas and architectures.
*   **Experimentation Framework:** Understand how to set up frameworks for experimenting with agent architectures: A/B testing, controlled experiments.
*   **Measuring Innovation:** Learn how to measure and evaluate experimental agent approaches: metrics, baselines, comparisons.
*   **Practical Exercise:** Design and prototype an experimental agent architecture to explore a new idea or approach.

## 🚀 Today's Goal

To learn how to experiment with and prototype new agent architectures, enabling innovation and exploration of cutting-edge agent concepts.

## 🤖 Prompt Examples

*   **Experimentation:** "What experimental agent architectures are being explored? What are the potential benefits and challenges?"
*   **Prototyping:** "How do you prototype experimental agent ideas? What's a good approach for testing new architectures?"
*   **Innovation:** "Design an experimental agent architecture that explores [new idea]. How would you test and evaluate it?"

## 💡 Today's Dictionary

*   **Experimental Architecture:** A novel or untested agent architecture that explores new ideas or approaches.
*   **Research Prototype:** A working implementation of an experimental idea used to test and validate concepts before production use.
*   **Innovation:** Developing new approaches, techniques, or architectures that advance the state of the art in agent development.
*   **Experimental Framework:** Tools and processes for building, testing, and evaluating experimental agent architectures.
