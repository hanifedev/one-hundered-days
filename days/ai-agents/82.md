# Day 82: Production Excellence - Advanced Error Handling and Recovery

## 📝 Today's Agenda

*   **Error Classification:** Learn to classify different types of agent errors: LLM errors, tool errors, logic errors, user errors.
*   **Recovery Strategies:** Understand recovery strategies for different error types: retries, fallbacks, escalation, graceful degradation.
*   **Error Prevention:** Learn techniques for preventing errors: input validation, pre-flight checks, confidence thresholds.
*   **User Communication:** Understand how to communicate errors to users effectively: clear messages, suggested actions, escalation paths.
*   **Practical Exercise:** Implement comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms in an agent system.

## 🚀 Today's Goal

To implement advanced error handling and recovery for agents, ensuring graceful failure handling and excellent user experience even when errors occur.

## 🤖 Prompt Examples

*   **Error Handling:** "What are the different types of errors agents can encounter? How do you handle each type effectively?"
*   **Recovery:** "Design an error recovery strategy for agents. How do you decide when to retry, fallback, or escalate?"
*   **User Experience:** "How do you communicate errors to users in a helpful way? What information should error messages include?"

## 💡 Today's Dictionary

*   **Error Classification:** Categorizing different types of errors (LLM, tool, logic, user) to apply appropriate handling strategies.
*   **Recovery Strategy:** A plan for handling errors, including retries, fallbacks, escalation, or graceful degradation.
*   **Graceful Degradation:** Continuing to provide reduced functionality when errors occur, rather than complete failure.
*   **Error Prevention:** Techniques for avoiding errors before they occur, such as validation, checks, and confidence thresholds.
