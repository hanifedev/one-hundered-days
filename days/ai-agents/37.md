# Day 37: Production Deployment - API Development and Integration

## 📝 Today's Agenda

*   **Agent APIs:** Learn how to expose agents as APIs (REST, GraphQL, WebSocket) for integration with other systems.
*   **API Design:** Understand best practices for designing agent APIs: endpoints, request/response formats, authentication, rate limiting.
*   **Async Processing:** Learn how to handle long-running agent tasks with async APIs and webhooks.
*   **API Documentation:** Create comprehensive API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger) for agent APIs.
*   **Practical Exercise:** Build a REST API wrapper for an agent and create API documentation.

## 🚀 Today's Goal

To learn how to expose AI agents as APIs, enabling integration with other systems and applications, with proper API design and documentation.

## 🤖 Prompt Examples

*   **Concept:** "Explain why exposing agents as APIs is important. What are the benefits and challenges?"
*   **Design:** "Design a REST API for an agent that processes documents. What endpoints would you need, and what would the request/response formats look like?"
*   **Implementation:** "Show me how to create a FastAPI endpoint that wraps a LangChain agent and handles async processing for long-running tasks."

## 💡 Today's Dictionary

*   **Agent API:** An application programming interface that exposes agent functionality for use by other systems and applications.
*   **REST API:** A web API that follows REST (Representational State Transfer) principles, using HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.).
*   **Async API:** An API that handles long-running operations asynchronously, often using background jobs and webhooks for completion.
*   **API Documentation:** Documentation that describes how to use an API, including endpoints, parameters, and response formats (often using OpenAPI/Swagger).
