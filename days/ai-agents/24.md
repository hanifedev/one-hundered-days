# Day 24: Cost Optimization for AI Agents

## 📝 Today's Agenda

*   **Understanding Agent Costs:** Breaking down where costs come from (API calls, token usage, tool execution, infrastructure).
*   **Token Optimization:** Strategies for reducing token usage (prompt compression, caching, efficient context management).
*   **Model Selection:** Choosing the right model for each task (using cheaper models for simple tasks, expensive ones only when needed).
*   **Caching and Memoization:** Implementing caching strategies to avoid redundant API calls and computations.
*   **Cost Monitoring:** Setting up cost tracking and alerts to stay within budget.

## 🚀 Today's Goal

To learn practical strategies for optimizing the cost of running AI agents in production while maintaining performance and quality.

## 🤖 Prompt Examples

*   **Analysis:** "An agent is making 50 API calls per user request. How would you analyze and optimize this to reduce costs?"
*   **Strategy:** "What are the trade-offs between using a cheaper, faster model versus a more expensive, higher-quality model for an agent?"
*   **Implementation:** "Design a caching strategy for an agent that answers frequently asked questions. What should be cached and for how long?"

## 💡 Today's Dictionary

*   **Token:** The basic unit of text that language models process (words, subwords, or characters depending on the tokenizer).
*   **Caching:** Storing the results of expensive operations so they can be reused without recomputing.
*   **Memoization:** A specific form of caching where function results are stored based on their input parameters.
