# Day 61: Advanced Database & Data Management - NoSQL Databases

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understanding NoSQL:** Learn about NoSQL databases and when to use them vs. SQL databases.
2.  **MongoDB with Mongoose:** Set up MongoDB in your NestJS application using Mongoose.
3.  **Mongoose Schemas:** Create Mongoose schemas and models for your data.
4.  **MongoDB Operations:** Perform CRUD operations and queries using Mongoose.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Build a feature using MongoDB, comparing it with your TypeORM implementation.

## 📖 Task Explanations

NoSQL databases like MongoDB are useful for flexible schemas, document storage, and horizontal scaling. Understanding when to use NoSQL vs. SQL helps you choose the right database for your use case. Mongoose provides a schema-based solution for MongoDB in Node.js.

Many applications benefit from using both SQL and NoSQL databases for different purposes. Understanding both enables you to make informed architectural decisions.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand NoSQL databases and how to use MongoDB with Mongoose in NestJS. You'll be able to create schemas, perform operations, and understand when NoSQL is appropriate. This knowledge enables you to choose the right database technology for different scenarios.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **NoSQL Database:** A database that doesn't use the traditional relational table structure (document, key-value, graph, column-family).
*   **MongoDB:** A popular NoSQL document database that stores data in JSON-like documents.
*   **Mongoose:** An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
*   **Document Database:** A NoSQL database that stores data in documents (like JSON objects).
*   **Schema Flexibility:** The ability to store documents with different structures in the same collection.
