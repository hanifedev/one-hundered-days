# Day 68: DevOps & Infrastructure - Infrastructure as Code

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understanding IaC:** Learn what Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is and its benefits (version control, reproducibility, automation).
2.  **Terraform Basics:** Learn the basics of Terraform for defining infrastructure as code.
3.  **Terraform for NestJS:** Create Terraform configurations for deploying NestJS applications and dependencies.
4.  **Infrastructure Versioning:** Version control your infrastructure configurations.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Define your application infrastructure using Terraform and deploy it.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) allows you to define and manage infrastructure using code. This enables version control, reproducibility, and automation of infrastructure changes. Terraform is a popular IaC tool that works with multiple cloud providers.

Understanding IaC enables you to manage infrastructure professionally, ensuring consistency across environments and enabling team collaboration. It's essential for modern DevOps practices.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand Infrastructure as Code and how to use Terraform. You'll be able to define infrastructure as code and manage it version-controlled. This knowledge enables you to manage infrastructure professionally and consistently.
