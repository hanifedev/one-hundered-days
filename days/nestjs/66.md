# Day 66: DevOps & Infrastructure - Kubernetes Basics

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understanding Kubernetes:** Learn what Kubernetes is and why it's used for container orchestration.
2.  **Kubernetes Concepts:** Understand core Kubernetes concepts (pods, services, deployments, namespaces).
3.  **Deploying NestJS:** Learn how to deploy NestJS applications to Kubernetes.
4.  **Kubernetes Manifests:** Write Kubernetes manifests (YAML files) for deploying your application.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Deploy a NestJS application to a Kubernetes cluster (local or cloud).

## 📖 Task Explanations

Kubernetes is the industry standard for container orchestration, enabling you to deploy, scale, and manage containerized applications. Understanding Kubernetes is essential for deploying applications at scale. It provides features like auto-scaling, load balancing, and self-healing.

Deploying NestJS applications to Kubernetes involves creating manifests that define how your application should run. Understanding Kubernetes enables you to deploy applications that can scale and handle production workloads effectively.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand Kubernetes basics and how to deploy NestJS applications to Kubernetes. You'll be able to create Kubernetes manifests and understand container orchestration. This knowledge enables you to deploy scalable, production-ready applications.
