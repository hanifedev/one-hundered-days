# Day 51: Real-World Patterns - Design Patterns in NestJS

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understanding Design Patterns:** Learn what design patterns are and why they're useful (reusable solutions to common problems).
2.  **Common Patterns:** Explore common design patterns used in NestJS (Factory, Strategy, Observer, Singleton).
3.  **Pattern Implementation:** Implement design patterns in your NestJS application.
4.  **NestJS Patterns:** Understand how NestJS itself uses design patterns (Dependency Injection, Module pattern).
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Refactor existing code to use appropriate design patterns, improving code organization and maintainability.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Design patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems. Understanding patterns helps you write more maintainable, flexible code. Many patterns are already used in NestJS (like Dependency Injection), and you can apply others to solve specific problems.

Learning design patterns improves your ability to design software effectively. Patterns provide a common vocabulary and proven approaches to solving problems.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand common design patterns and how to apply them in NestJS applications. You'll be able to recognize when to use patterns and implement them effectively. This knowledge enables you to write more maintainable, well-designed code.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Design Pattern:** A reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design.
*   **Factory Pattern:** A pattern that creates objects without specifying the exact class of object to create.
*   **Strategy Pattern:** A pattern that defines a family of algorithms and makes them interchangeable.
*   **Observer Pattern:** A pattern where objects notify observers of state changes.
*   **Singleton Pattern:** A pattern that ensures a class has only one instance.
