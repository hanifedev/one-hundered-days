# Day 44: API Design & Documentation - GraphQL Introduction

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understanding GraphQL:** Learn what GraphQL is and how it differs from REST (single endpoint, client-specified queries).
2.  **GraphQL Setup:** Install and configure GraphQL in your NestJS application using `@nestjs/graphql`.
3.  **Schema Definition:** Learn how to define GraphQL schemas using decorators and code-first approach.
4.  **Resolvers:** Create GraphQL resolvers to handle queries and mutations.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Build a simple GraphQL API alongside your REST API and compare the two approaches.

## 📖 Task Explanations

GraphQL is an alternative to REST that allows clients to request exactly the data they need. It provides a single endpoint and a flexible query language. NestJS provides excellent GraphQL support with both code-first and schema-first approaches.

Understanding GraphQL enables you to choose the right API style for your use case. GraphQL is particularly useful when clients need flexible data fetching or when you want to reduce over-fetching and under-fetching of data.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand GraphQL and how to implement it in NestJS applications. You'll be able to create GraphQL schemas, resolvers, and queries. This knowledge enables you to build flexible APIs that give clients control over data fetching.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **GraphQL:** A query language and runtime for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need.
*   **Resolver:** A function that handles GraphQL queries and mutations, fetching data from data sources.
*   **Schema:** The structure that defines what data can be queried in a GraphQL API.
*   **Query:** A read operation in GraphQL that fetches data.
*   **Mutation:** A write operation in GraphQL that modifies data.
