# Day 26: Database Advanced - Relations and Associations

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understanding Relations:** Learn about database relations (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many) in TypeORM.
2.  **One-to-Many Relations:** Implement a one-to-many relationship (e.g., User has many Posts).
3.  **Many-to-Many Relations:** Implement a many-to-many relationship (e.g., Posts have many Tags, Tags belong to many Posts).
4.  **Relation Decorators:** Use TypeORM decorators (@OneToMany, @ManyToOne, @ManyToMany) to define relationships.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Create entities with different types of relations and query related data.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Database relations are fundamental for modeling real-world data. TypeORM provides powerful decorators and methods for defining and working with relationships. Understanding relations enables you to build complex data models that accurately represent your domain.

One-to-many and many-to-many relationships are common in real-world applications. Learning to implement and query these relationships is essential for building production-ready applications.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand how to define and work with database relations in TypeORM. You'll be able to implement one-to-many and many-to-many relationships and query related data efficiently. This knowledge enables you to build complex data models.
