# Day 67: DevOps & Infrastructure - Cloud Platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP)

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Cloud Platform Overview:** Learn about major cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) and their services.
2.  **Cloud Services for Backend:** Understand cloud services relevant to backend development (compute, databases, storage, messaging).
3.  **Deploying to Cloud:** Learn how to deploy NestJS applications to cloud platforms.
4.  **Cloud Configuration:** Configure cloud services (databases, caches, message queues) for your application.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Deploy a NestJS application to a cloud platform and configure necessary services.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Cloud platforms provide managed services that simplify infrastructure management. Understanding cloud platforms enables you to deploy applications without managing servers directly. Each platform offers similar services with different names and configurations.

Deploying to cloud platforms often involves using Platform as a Service (PaaS) or container services. Understanding cloud deployment enables you to leverage managed services and scale applications effectively.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand cloud platforms and how to deploy NestJS applications to them. You'll know how to configure cloud services and leverage managed infrastructure. This knowledge enables you to deploy applications to production cloud environments.
