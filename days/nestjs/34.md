# Day 34: Microservices & Advanced Patterns - WebSockets

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understanding WebSockets:** Learn what WebSockets are and how they enable real-time, bidirectional communication.
2.  **Socket.io Integration:** Set up Socket.io in your NestJS application for WebSocket support.
3.  **Gateway Creation:** Create WebSocket gateways to handle real-time events.
4.  **Real-Time Features:** Implement real-time features like chat, notifications, or live updates.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Build a simple real-time feature (e.g., a chat room or live notifications) using WebSockets.

## 📖 Task Explanations

WebSockets provide persistent, bidirectional communication between client and server, enabling real-time features like chat, live notifications, and collaborative editing. NestJS integrates seamlessly with Socket.io, making it easy to add WebSocket support to your application.

Understanding WebSockets enables you to build interactive, real-time applications. This is essential for modern applications that require instant updates and user interaction.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand how to implement WebSockets in NestJS applications. You'll be able to create WebSocket gateways, handle real-time events, and build interactive features. This knowledge enables you to build modern, real-time applications.
