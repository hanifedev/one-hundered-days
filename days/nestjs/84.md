# Day 84: Advanced Integration - External APIs and Webhooks

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **External API Integration:** Learn how to integrate with external APIs (REST, GraphQL) from your NestJS application.
2.  **API Client Patterns:** Implement API clients with retry logic, error handling, and rate limiting.
3.  **Webhook Implementation:** Create webhook endpoints to receive notifications from external services.
4.  **Webhook Security:** Implement webhook signature verification for security.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Integrate with external APIs and implement webhook handlers for receiving external events.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Integrating with external APIs enables your application to leverage third-party services and data. Understanding API integration patterns (retry logic, error handling, rate limiting) ensures reliable external service communication. Webhooks enable real-time notifications from external services.

Webhook security is crucial—verifying webhook signatures ensures requests are authentic. Understanding webhook patterns enables you to build integrations that respond to external events reliably.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand how to integrate with external APIs and implement webhooks in NestJS applications. You'll be able to create reliable API clients and secure webhook handlers. This knowledge enables you to build applications that integrate with external services effectively.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **External API:** An API provided by a third-party service that your application consumes.
*   **API Client:** Code that makes requests to external APIs with proper error handling and retry logic.
*   **Webhook:** A callback mechanism where external services send HTTP requests to notify your application of events.
*   **Webhook Signature:** A cryptographic signature that verifies webhook requests are authentic.
*   **Retry Logic:** Automatically retrying failed API requests with exponential backoff.
