# Day 58: Advanced Topics - Serverless and NestJS

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understanding Serverless:** Learn what serverless architecture is and its benefits (auto-scaling, pay-per-use, no server management).
2.  **Serverless Platforms:** Explore serverless platforms (AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions).
3.  **NestJS Serverless:** Learn how to deploy NestJS applications to serverless platforms.
4.  **Serverless Considerations:** Understand considerations for serverless (cold starts, timeouts, stateless design).
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Deploy a NestJS application to a serverless platform and understand the deployment process.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Serverless architecture allows you to run code without managing servers. Functions are executed on-demand, and you only pay for execution time. NestJS can be adapted for serverless deployment, though it requires some considerations.

Understanding serverless enables you to build applications that scale automatically and reduce infrastructure costs. It's particularly useful for applications with variable or unpredictable traffic.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand serverless architecture and how to deploy NestJS applications to serverless platforms. You'll know the benefits and considerations of serverless and when it's appropriate. This knowledge enables you to choose the right deployment model for your applications.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Serverless:** A cloud computing model where code runs in stateless compute containers managed by a cloud provider.
*   **Function as a Service (FaaS):** A serverless computing service that executes functions in response to events.
*   **Cold Start:** The delay when a serverless function is invoked after being idle.
*   **Stateless:** Not maintaining state between requests, required for serverless functions.
*   **Auto-Scaling:** Automatically adjusting resources based on demand.
