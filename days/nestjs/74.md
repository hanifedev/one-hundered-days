# Day 74: Enterprise Patterns - Service Mesh

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understanding Service Mesh:** Learn what a service mesh is and how it manages service-to-service communication.
2.  **Service Mesh Benefits:** Understand benefits (traffic management, security, observability, resilience).
3.  **Service Mesh Tools:** Explore service mesh tools (Istio, Linkerd, Consul Connect).
4.  **Service Mesh Integration:** Understand how to integrate NestJS microservices with a service mesh.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Set up a service mesh for your microservices and configure traffic policies.

## 📖 Task Explanations

A service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer for managing service-to-service communication. It provides features like traffic management, security, observability, and resilience without requiring changes to application code. Service meshes are valuable for complex microservices architectures.

Understanding service meshes enables you to build microservices architectures with advanced traffic management and observability. While not needed for all applications, they're valuable for large, complex systems.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand service meshes and their role in microservices architectures. You'll know how service meshes work and when they're appropriate. This knowledge enables you to make informed decisions about microservices infrastructure.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Service Mesh:** A dedicated infrastructure layer for managing service-to-service communication in microservices.
*   **Sidecar Pattern:** A pattern where a proxy runs alongside each service instance to handle communication.
*   **Traffic Management:** Controlling how traffic flows between services (routing, load balancing, circuit breaking).
*   **mTLS (Mutual TLS):** Encrypted communication between services using mutual authentication.
*   **Service-to-Service Communication:** Communication between microservices in a distributed system.
