# Day 76: Specialized Topics - Advanced Message Brokers

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Message Broker Comparison:** Compare different message brokers (RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka, AWS SQS, Azure Service Bus).
2.  **Apache Kafka:** Learn about Apache Kafka and its use cases (event streaming, log aggregation).
3.  **Kafka Integration:** Integrate Apache Kafka with your NestJS application.
4.  **Event Streaming:** Implement event streaming patterns using Kafka.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Build a feature using Kafka for event streaming and message processing.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Different message brokers serve different purposes. Kafka is excellent for event streaming and high-throughput scenarios, while RabbitMQ is great for traditional message queuing. Understanding different brokers helps you choose the right tool for your use case.

Event streaming with Kafka enables building event-driven architectures that can process large volumes of events in real-time. This is valuable for analytics, real-time processing, and event-driven systems.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand different message brokers and when to use each. You'll be able to integrate Kafka with NestJS and implement event streaming. This knowledge enables you to choose the right messaging solution for different scenarios.
