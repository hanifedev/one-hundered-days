# Day 39: Production & Deployment - Security Best Practices

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Security Overview:** Learn about common security vulnerabilities in web applications (OWASP Top 10).
2.  **Input Validation:** Ensure all inputs are properly validated and sanitized.
3.  **Authentication Security:** Review and strengthen authentication and authorization mechanisms.
4.  **HTTPS and Security Headers:** Configure HTTPS and security headers (CORS, CSP, etc.).
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Review your application's security and implement security best practices.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Security is crucial for production applications. Understanding common vulnerabilities and implementing security best practices protects your application and users. This includes proper input validation, secure authentication, HTTPS, and security headers.

Security should be considered throughout development, not just at the end. Understanding security best practices enables you to build secure applications from the start.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand security best practices for NestJS applications. You'll be able to identify common vulnerabilities, implement proper security measures, and protect your applications. This knowledge enables you to build secure, production-ready applications.
