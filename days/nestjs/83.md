# Day 83: Advanced Integration - OAuth and Social Authentication

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **OAuth Overview:** Learn about OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect for third-party authentication.
2.  **Social Authentication:** Implement social login (Google, Facebook, GitHub) using Passport strategies.
3.  **OAuth Flow:** Understand the OAuth authorization flow and implement it in your application.
4.  **Token Management:** Handle OAuth tokens and refresh tokens properly.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Build authentication that supports both traditional login and social OAuth providers.

## 📖 Task Explanations

OAuth enables users to authenticate using third-party services (Google, Facebook, GitHub), improving user experience by eliminating the need to create new accounts. Understanding OAuth is essential for modern applications that want to offer social login options.

OAuth 2.0 is the industry standard for authorization, and OpenID Connect extends it for authentication. Understanding these protocols enables you to integrate with any OAuth provider.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand OAuth 2.0 and how to implement social authentication in NestJS applications. You'll be able to integrate multiple OAuth providers and handle OAuth flows properly. This knowledge enables you to build applications with flexible authentication options.
