# Day 75: Enterprise Patterns - Practice Project

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Project Goal:** Build a microservices system that demonstrates enterprise patterns (Saga, Circuit Breaker, API Gateway).
2.  **Pattern Implementation:** Implement multiple enterprise patterns in your microservices architecture.
3.  **Resilience:** Ensure your system handles failures gracefully using circuit breakers and Sagas.
4.  **Architecture:** Design a microservices architecture with proper separation of concerns.
5.  **Integration:** Ensure all patterns work together to create a robust, scalable system.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today you'll consolidate your enterprise patterns knowledge by building a microservices system that uses multiple patterns. This project will demonstrate your ability to design and implement enterprise-grade microservices architectures. Focus on creating a system that is resilient, scalable, and well-architected.

This project will showcase your understanding of enterprise patterns and microservices architecture. It will be a valuable addition to your portfolio, demonstrating your ability to build production-ready distributed systems.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have built a microservices system that demonstrates your mastery of enterprise patterns. You'll have practical experience with Sagas, circuit breakers, API Gateways, and service mesh concepts. This project demonstrates your ability to build enterprise-grade distributed systems.
