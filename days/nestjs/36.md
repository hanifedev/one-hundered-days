# Day 36: Production & Deployment - Docker and Containerization

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understanding Docker:** Learn what Docker is and why it's useful for deployment (consistency, isolation, portability).
2.  **Dockerfile Creation:** Create a Dockerfile for your NestJS application.
3.  **Docker Compose:** Set up Docker Compose to orchestrate your application and dependencies (database, Redis).
4.  **Multi-Stage Builds:** Optimize your Docker image using multi-stage builds.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Containerize your NestJS application and run it with Docker Compose.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Docker containerizes applications, ensuring they run consistently across different environments. This is essential for reliable deployments. Docker Compose allows you to define and run multi-container applications, making it easy to set up development and production environments.

Understanding Docker is crucial for modern backend development. It enables consistent deployments and simplifies infrastructure management.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand how to containerize your NestJS applications using Docker. You'll be able to create Dockerfiles, use Docker Compose, and deploy containerized applications. This knowledge enables you to deploy applications reliably and consistently.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Docker:** A platform for containerizing applications, ensuring they run consistently across environments.
*   **Container:** A lightweight, isolated environment that runs an application and its dependencies.
*   **Dockerfile:** A file that defines how to build a Docker image for your application.
*   **Docker Compose:** A tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
*   **Multi-Stage Build:** A Docker build strategy that creates smaller, optimized images.
