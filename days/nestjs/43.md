# Day 43: API Design & Documentation - Rate Limiting and Throttling

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understanding Rate Limiting:** Learn what rate limiting is and why it's important (preventing abuse, ensuring fair usage).
2.  **Rate Limiting Setup:** Implement rate limiting in your NestJS application using `@nestjs/throttler`.
3.  **Rate Limit Strategies:** Configure different rate limit strategies (per IP, per user, per endpoint).
4.  **Custom Rate Limiting:** Implement custom rate limiting logic for specific use cases.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Set up rate limiting for your API endpoints and test different rate limit scenarios.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Rate limiting protects your API from abuse and ensures fair resource usage. It prevents individual users or IPs from overwhelming your server with too many requests. Understanding rate limiting is essential for production APIs.

Different endpoints may need different rate limits—public endpoints might have stricter limits, while authenticated endpoints might have higher limits. Configuring rate limiting appropriately protects your application while providing good user experience.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand how to implement rate limiting in NestJS applications. You'll be able to protect your API from abuse and ensure fair resource usage. This knowledge enables you to build robust, production-ready APIs.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Rate Limiting:** Restricting the number of requests a client can make within a specific time period.
*   **Throttling:** Controlling the rate at which requests are processed, similar to rate limiting.
*   **API Abuse:** Excessive or malicious use of an API that can degrade performance or cause issues.
*   **Fair Usage:** Ensuring that API resources are distributed fairly among all users.
*   **Request Quota:** The maximum number of requests allowed within a time period.
