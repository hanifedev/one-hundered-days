# Day 23: Advanced Features - Custom Pipes and Decorators

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Custom Pipes:** Learn how to create custom validation and transformation pipes.
2.  **Pipe Transformation:** Build pipes that transform input data (e.g., parsing strings to numbers, formatting dates).
3.  **Custom Decorators:** Create custom parameter decorators to extract data from requests.
4. **Decorator Metadata:** Understand how to use metadata in custom decorators for more advanced use cases.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Create custom pipes for data transformation and custom decorators for extracting user information from requests.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Pipes are used for transformation and validation. While NestJS provides built-in pipes, creating custom pipes gives you more control over data processing. Custom decorators allow you to create reusable ways to extract data from requests, making your code more expressive and maintainable.

Understanding custom pipes and decorators enables you to create domain-specific validation and data extraction logic. This is essential for building clean, maintainable APIs with clear separation of concerns.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand how to create custom pipes and decorators in NestJS. You'll be able to implement custom validation logic, transform data, and create expressive parameter decorators. This knowledge enables you to build more flexible and maintainable applications.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Custom Pipe:** A class that implements the `PipeTransform` interface for custom transformation or validation logic.
*   **Custom Decorator:** A function that returns a parameter decorator, allowing you to extract and transform request data.
*   **Parameter Decorator:** A decorator that can be applied to method parameters to extract or transform data.
*   **Metadata:** Additional information attached to classes, methods, or parameters using decorators.
*   **Data Transformation:** Converting data from one format to another (e.g., string to number, date formatting).
