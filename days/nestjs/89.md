# Day 89: Performance & Optimization Advanced - Memory and Resource Optimization

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Memory Management:** Understand memory usage in Node.js applications and identify memory leaks.
2.  **Memory Profiling:** Use memory profiling tools to identify memory leaks and excessive memory usage.
3.  **Resource Optimization:** Optimize CPU, memory, and I/O usage in your application.
4.  **Garbage Collection:** Understand Node.js garbage collection and optimize for better performance.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Profile your application's memory usage, identify issues, and optimize resource consumption.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Memory and resource optimization are crucial for applications that need to run efficiently. Memory leaks can cause applications to crash or slow down over time. Understanding memory management and profiling enables you to build applications that use resources efficiently.

Resource optimization (CPU, memory, I/O) ensures your application performs well and doesn't waste resources. This is especially important for applications that need to scale or run on limited resources.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand memory management and resource optimization in Node.js applications. You'll be able to identify memory leaks, profile resource usage, and optimize applications for efficiency. This knowledge enables you to build applications that use resources effectively.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Memory Leak:** A bug where memory is allocated but never freed, causing memory usage to grow over time.
*   **Memory Profiling:** Analyzing memory usage to identify leaks and excessive consumption.
*   **Garbage Collection:** Automatic memory management that frees memory no longer in use.
*   **Resource Optimization:** Improving how applications use CPU, memory, and I/O resources.
*   **Heap Memory:** Memory used for dynamic allocation in Node.js applications.
