# Day 47: Testing Advanced - Test Coverage and Quality

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understanding Test Coverage:** Learn what test coverage is and why it's important (identifying untested code).
2.  **Coverage Tools:** Set up test coverage tools (like Istanbul/nyc) to measure code coverage.
3.  **Coverage Metrics:** Understand different coverage metrics (line coverage, branch coverage, function coverage).
4.  **Coverage Goals:** Set appropriate coverage goals and identify critical paths that need high coverage.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Measure test coverage for your application and identify areas that need more tests.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Test coverage measures how much of your code is executed by tests. While high coverage doesn't guarantee quality, it helps identify untested code. Understanding coverage metrics helps you focus testing efforts on critical paths.

Setting realistic coverage goals (e.g., 80% overall, 100% for critical paths) helps maintain code quality without over-testing. Coverage tools provide insights into which parts of your codebase need more testing.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand how to measure and improve test coverage. You'll be able to use coverage tools, interpret coverage reports, and focus testing efforts effectively. This knowledge enables you to build well-tested applications.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Test Coverage:** A metric that measures how much of your code is executed by tests.
*   **Line Coverage:** The percentage of code lines executed by tests.
*   **Branch Coverage:** The percentage of code branches (if/else, switch cases) executed by tests.
*   **Coverage Report:** A report that shows which parts of your code are covered by tests.
*   **Coverage Goal:** A target percentage of code coverage to maintain.
