# Day 24: Advanced Features - Exception Filters

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understanding Exception Filters:** Learn what exception filters are and how they handle exceptions globally or per route.
2.  **Built-in Exceptions:** Explore NestJS built-in exceptions (HttpException, BadRequestException, etc.).
3.  **Custom Exception Filters:** Create custom exception filters to format error responses consistently.
4.  **Global Exception Filters:** Implement a global exception filter to handle all exceptions in your application.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Create a custom exception filter that formats error responses and handles different exception types appropriately.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Exception filters give you control over how exceptions are handled and what response is sent to the client. They can catch exceptions thrown by controllers, services, or guards and transform them into appropriate HTTP responses. Global exception filters ensure consistent error handling across your entire application.

Understanding exception filters is crucial for building production-ready applications. They allow you to format error responses consistently, log errors appropriately, and provide meaningful error messages to clients.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand how to create and use exception filters in NestJS. You'll be able to handle exceptions gracefully, format error responses consistently, and implement global error handling. This knowledge enables you to build robust applications with proper error handling.
