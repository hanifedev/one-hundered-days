# Day 78: Specialized Topics - File Storage and Processing

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **File Storage Options:** Learn about different file storage options (local, cloud storage like S3, Azure Blob, Google Cloud Storage).
2.  **Cloud Storage Integration:** Integrate cloud storage (AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage) with your NestJS application.
3.  **File Upload:** Implement secure file upload functionality with validation and size limits.
4.  **File Processing:** Process uploaded files (image resizing, document conversion, virus scanning).
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Build a file upload and storage system with cloud storage integration.

## 📖 Task Explanations

File storage and processing are common requirements in applications. Cloud storage provides scalable, reliable file storage without managing infrastructure. Understanding file upload security and processing enables you to build applications that handle files safely and efficiently.

File processing (resizing images, converting formats, extracting metadata) often needs to happen asynchronously to avoid blocking requests. Understanding these patterns enables you to build robust file handling systems.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand how to implement file storage and processing in NestJS applications. You'll be able to integrate cloud storage, handle file uploads securely, and process files. This knowledge enables you to build applications that handle file operations professionally.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Cloud Storage:** File storage provided by cloud platforms (S3, Azure Blob, Google Cloud Storage).
*   **Object Storage:** A storage architecture that manages data as objects rather than files or blocks.
*   **File Upload:** The process of transferring files from a client to a server.
*   **File Processing:** Operations performed on files (resizing, conversion, validation, etc.).
*   **CDN (Content Delivery Network):** A network of servers that deliver content (including files) to users based on geographic location.
