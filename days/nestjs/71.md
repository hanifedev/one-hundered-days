# Day 71: Enterprise Patterns - Saga Pattern

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understanding Distributed Transactions:** Learn why traditional transactions don't work across microservices.
2.  **Saga Pattern:** Learn about the Saga pattern for managing distributed transactions.
3.  **Saga Implementation:** Implement a Saga pattern for coordinating multiple microservice operations.
4.  **Compensation:** Understand compensation (rollback) strategies in Sagas.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Build a feature that uses the Saga pattern to coordinate operations across services.

## 📖 Task Explanations

The Saga pattern is essential for managing distributed transactions in microservices architectures. Unlike traditional ACID transactions, Sagas use a series of local transactions with compensation logic. This enables distributed systems to maintain data consistency across services.

Understanding the Saga pattern enables you to build microservices that can coordinate complex operations reliably. It's a fundamental pattern for distributed systems.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand the Saga pattern and how to implement it in NestJS microservices. You'll be able to coordinate distributed operations and handle failures gracefully. This knowledge enables you to build reliable distributed systems.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Saga Pattern:** A pattern for managing distributed transactions using a series of local transactions with compensation.
*   **Distributed Transaction:** A transaction that spans multiple services or databases.
*   **Compensation:** A rollback mechanism that undoes the effects of previous operations in a Saga.
*   **Orchestration:** A Saga approach where a central coordinator manages the transaction flow.
*   **Choreography:** A Saga approach where each service knows what to do next without a central coordinator.
