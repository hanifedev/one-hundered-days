# Day 73: Enterprise Patterns - API Gateway

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understanding API Gateway:** Learn what an API Gateway is and its role in microservices architectures.
2.  **API Gateway Functions:** Understand API Gateway responsibilities (routing, authentication, rate limiting, load balancing).
3.  **NestJS as API Gateway:** Use NestJS to build an API Gateway for your microservices.
4.  **Service Discovery:** Implement service discovery for dynamic service routing.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Build an API Gateway that routes requests to multiple microservices.

## 📖 Task Explanations

An API Gateway is a single entry point for client requests, routing them to appropriate microservices. It handles cross-cutting concerns like authentication, rate limiting, and request routing. API Gateways simplify client interactions with microservices architectures.

Understanding API Gateways enables you to build microservices architectures that are easier to manage and scale. It's a fundamental pattern for microservices architectures.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand API Gateways and how to build them with NestJS. You'll be able to route requests, handle authentication, and manage microservices from a single entry point. This knowledge enables you to build professional microservices architectures.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **API Gateway:** A single entry point that routes client requests to appropriate microservices.
*   **Service Discovery:** A mechanism for automatically detecting and connecting to available services.
*   **Request Routing:** Directing incoming requests to the appropriate service based on path, method, or other criteria.
*   **Cross-Cutting Concerns:** Functionality that applies across multiple services (authentication, logging, rate limiting).
*   **Microservices Architecture:** An architecture where applications are built as a collection of small, independent services.
