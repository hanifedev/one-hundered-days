# Day 21: Advanced Features - Interceptors

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understanding Interceptors:** Learn what interceptors are and how they work in the NestJS request lifecycle.
2.  **Creating Custom Interceptors:** Create your first custom interceptor to transform responses or add metadata.
3.  **Response Transformation:** Use interceptors to transform response data before sending it to clients.
4.  **Logging Interceptor:** Build an interceptor that logs request and response information.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Create interceptors for response transformation and request logging in your application.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Interceptors are a powerful feature in NestJS that allow you to intercept method execution before and after it happens. They can transform responses, add extra logic, extend method behavior, or completely override method execution. Interceptors are useful for cross-cutting concerns like logging, caching, and response transformation.

Understanding interceptors gives you fine-grained control over request/response handling. They run after guards but before pipes, making them perfect for transforming data or adding metadata to responses.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand how to create and use interceptors in NestJS. You'll be able to transform responses, add logging, and implement cross-cutting concerns. This knowledge enables you to build more sophisticated and maintainable applications.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Interceptor:** A class that implements the `NestInterceptor` interface, allowing you to intercept method execution.
*   **Request Lifecycle:** The sequence of steps a request goes through in NestJS (middleware → guards → interceptors → pipes → controller → service).
*   **Response Transformation:** Modifying response data before it's sent to the client.
*   **Cross-Cutting Concern:** Functionality that affects multiple parts of an application (logging, caching, transformation).
