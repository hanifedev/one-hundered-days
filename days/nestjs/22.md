# Day 22: Advanced Features - Middleware

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understanding Middleware:** Learn what middleware is and how it differs from interceptors and guards.
2.  **Creating Custom Middleware:** Create functional or class-based middleware in NestJS.
3.  **Middleware Execution Order:** Understand when middleware runs in the request lifecycle (before guards, interceptors, and pipes).
4.  **Common Middleware Use Cases:** Implement middleware for logging, CORS, request parsing, and authentication.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Create middleware for request logging and implement CORS configuration.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Middleware functions have access to the request and response objects and the next middleware function in the chain. They can execute code, make changes to the request and response objects, end the request-response cycle, or call the next middleware. Middleware runs before guards, making it useful for request preprocessing.

Understanding middleware is essential for handling cross-cutting concerns that need to run early in the request lifecycle. Common use cases include logging, authentication checks, request parsing, and CORS configuration.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand how to create and use middleware in NestJS. You'll know when to use middleware vs. guards vs. interceptors, and be able to implement common middleware patterns. This knowledge enables you to handle request preprocessing effectively.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Middleware:** Functions that execute during the request-response cycle, having access to request, response, and next function.
*   **Request Lifecycle:** The order in which NestJS processes requests (middleware → guards → interceptors → pipes → controller).
*   **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):** A mechanism that allows resources to be requested from another domain.
*   **Functional Middleware:** A simple function-based middleware implementation.
*   **Class-Based Middleware:** A middleware implemented as a class using the `NestMiddleware` interface.
