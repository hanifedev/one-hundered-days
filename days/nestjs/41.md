# Day 41: API Design & Documentation - RESTful API Design

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **REST Principles:** Learn the core principles of REST (Representational State Transfer) architecture.
2.  **HTTP Methods:** Understand proper use of HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) and status codes.
3.  **Resource Naming:** Learn best practices for naming API endpoints and resources.
4.  **API Versioning:** Understand different approaches to API versioning (URL, headers, query parameters).
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Design and implement a RESTful API following best practices for resource naming and HTTP methods.

## 📖 Task Explanations

RESTful API design is fundamental for building well-structured, maintainable APIs. Understanding REST principles helps you create APIs that are intuitive, consistent, and easy to use. Proper use of HTTP methods and status codes makes your API self-documenting and follows industry standards.

API versioning is crucial for maintaining backward compatibility as your API evolves. Understanding different versioning strategies helps you choose the right approach for your application.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand RESTful API design principles and best practices. You'll be able to design clean, intuitive APIs that follow industry standards. This knowledge enables you to build APIs that are easy to use and maintain.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **REST (Representational State Transfer):** An architectural style for designing networked applications.
*   **HTTP Method:** The type of operation being performed (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE).
*   **HTTP Status Code:** A numeric code that indicates the result of an HTTP request (200, 404, 500, etc.).
*   **Resource:** A conceptual mapping to a set of entities in your application (e.g., /users, /posts).
*   **API Versioning:** The practice of managing changes to your API while maintaining backward compatibility.
