# Day 59: Advanced Topics - Advanced Security

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Security Review:** Review and strengthen security measures in your application (authentication, authorization, input validation).
2.  **OWASP Top 10:** Deep dive into OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities and how to prevent them in NestJS.
3.  **Security Headers:** Implement comprehensive security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.).
4.  **Security Auditing:** Learn how to audit your application for security vulnerabilities.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Conduct a security audit of your application and implement additional security measures.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Advanced security goes beyond basic authentication and authorization. Understanding OWASP Top 10 helps you identify and prevent common vulnerabilities. Security headers provide additional layers of protection. Regular security auditing ensures your application remains secure as it evolves.

Security is an ongoing concern, not a one-time task. Understanding advanced security practices enables you to build applications that protect users and data effectively.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand advanced security practices for NestJS applications. You'll be able to identify common vulnerabilities, implement security headers, and conduct security audits. This knowledge enables you to build secure, production-ready applications.
