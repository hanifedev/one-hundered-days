# Day 96: Final Mastery - System Design and Architecture

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **System Design Principles:** Review and apply system design principles (scalability, reliability, availability, maintainability).
2.  **Architecture Patterns:** Review architectural patterns and choose appropriate patterns for different scenarios.
3.  **System Design Exercise:** Design a complete system architecture for a real-world application (e.g., social media, e-commerce, ride-sharing).
4.  **Technology Choices:** Justify technology choices based on requirements and constraints.
5.  **Architecture Documentation:** Document your system design with diagrams and explanations.

## 📖 Task Explanations

System design is about architecting complete systems that meet requirements for scale, reliability, and performance. Understanding system design principles enables you to design systems that can grow and adapt. This is essential for senior-level development roles.

Designing systems from scratch helps you understand how all the pieces fit together. It's a valuable skill for technical interviews and real-world system architecture.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand system design principles and be able to design complete system architectures. You'll be able to make informed technology choices and document system designs. This knowledge enables you to architect systems at any scale.
