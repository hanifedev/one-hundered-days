# Day 70: DevOps & Infrastructure - Scaling and Load Balancing

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understanding Scaling:** Learn about horizontal and vertical scaling and when to use each.
2.  **Load Balancing:** Understand load balancing strategies and implement load balancing for your application.
3.  **Auto-Scaling:** Configure auto-scaling based on metrics (CPU, memory, request rate).
4.  **Performance Under Load:** Test your application under load and optimize for scalability.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Set up load balancing and auto-scaling for your NestJS application.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Scaling is essential for applications that need to handle varying loads. Horizontal scaling (adding more instances) is often preferred over vertical scaling (increasing instance size). Load balancing distributes traffic across multiple instances, improving performance and availability.

Understanding scaling and load balancing enables you to build applications that can handle growth. Auto-scaling automatically adjusts resources based on demand, optimizing costs and performance.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand scaling strategies and load balancing. You'll be able to configure auto-scaling and load balancing for your applications. This knowledge enables you to build applications that can scale to handle increased load.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Horizontal Scaling:** Adding more instances of an application to handle increased load.
*   **Vertical Scaling:** Increasing the resources (CPU, memory) of a single instance.
*   **Load Balancing:** Distributing incoming requests across multiple application instances.
*   **Auto-Scaling:** Automatically adjusting the number of instances based on metrics (CPU, memory, request rate).
*   **Load Testing:** Testing application performance under expected or peak load conditions.
