# Day 33: Microservices & Advanced Patterns - Caching

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understanding Caching:** Learn what caching is and why it's important for performance (reducing database load, faster responses).
2.  **Redis Caching:** Set up Redis as a cache store in your NestJS application.
3.  **Cache Interceptor:** Use NestJS's built-in cache interceptor to cache responses automatically.
4.  **Manual Caching:** Implement manual caching for specific operations using the Cache Manager.
5.  **Cache Invalidation:** Learn strategies for invalidating cache when data changes.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Caching stores frequently accessed data in fast storage (like Redis) to avoid expensive operations like database queries. It significantly improves application performance and reduces database load. NestJS provides built-in caching support that makes it easy to cache responses.

Understanding caching strategies and cache invalidation is crucial for building performant applications. Proper caching can dramatically improve response times and reduce infrastructure costs.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand how to implement caching in NestJS applications. You'll be able to use Redis for caching, implement automatic and manual caching, and handle cache invalidation. This knowledge enables you to build high-performance applications.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Cache:** Fast storage used to store frequently accessed data, reducing the need to fetch it from slower sources.
*   **Cache Hit:** When requested data is found in the cache.
*   **Cache Miss:** When requested data is not in the cache and must be fetched from the source.
*   **Cache Invalidation:** Removing or updating cached data when the source data changes.
*   **TTL (Time To Live):** The duration that cached data remains valid before being automatically removed.
