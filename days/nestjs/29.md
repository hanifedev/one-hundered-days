# Day 29: Database Advanced - Query Builder

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understanding Query Builder:** Learn what TypeORM's Query Builder is and when to use it instead of repository methods.
2. **Basic Query Builder:** Write queries using the Query Builder API for complex queries.
3.  **Joins and Relations:** Use Query Builder to perform joins and load related data efficiently.
4.  **Aggregations:** Learn how to use Query Builder for aggregations (COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.).
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Rewrite complex queries using Query Builder and compare performance with repository methods.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Query Builder provides a programmatic way to build SQL queries, giving you more control and flexibility than repository methods. It's especially useful for complex queries, joins, aggregations, and dynamic query building. Understanding Query Builder enables you to write efficient, complex database queries.

Query Builder is essential for performance-critical queries and complex data retrieval scenarios. It allows you to optimize queries and work with raw SQL when needed.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand how to use TypeORM's Query Builder for complex database queries. You'll be able to write efficient queries with joins, aggregations, and dynamic conditions. This knowledge enables you to build performant applications with complex data requirements.
