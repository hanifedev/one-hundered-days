# Day 31: Microservices & Advanced Patterns - Introduction to Microservices

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understanding Microservices:** Learn what microservices architecture is and how it differs from monolithic architecture.
2.  **NestJS Microservices:** Explore NestJS's built-in support for microservices using different transports (TCP, Redis, RabbitMQ, etc.).
3.  **Creating a Microservice:** Set up your first NestJS microservice with TCP transport.
4.  **Message Patterns:** Learn about request-response and event-based communication patterns.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Create a simple microservice and communicate with it from your main application.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Microservices architecture breaks applications into smaller, independent services that communicate over a network. NestJS provides excellent support for building microservices with various transport mechanisms. Understanding microservices enables you to build scalable, distributed systems.

Microservices are useful for large applications that need to scale different parts independently. They also enable teams to work on different services independently.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand microservices architecture and how to create microservices in NestJS. You'll know how to set up communication between services and understand different message patterns. This knowledge enables you to build scalable, distributed applications.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Microservice:** A small, independent service that communicates with other services over a network.
*   **Monolithic Architecture:** A traditional architecture where all functionality is in a single application.
*   **Transport:** The communication mechanism used by microservices (TCP, Redis, RabbitMQ, etc.).
*   **Message Pattern:** The way services communicate (request-response, event-based, publish-subscribe).
*   **Service Communication:** How different microservices exchange data and coordinate operations.
