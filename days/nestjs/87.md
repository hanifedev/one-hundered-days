# Day 87: Performance & Optimization Advanced - Advanced Caching Strategies

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Caching Patterns:** Learn advanced caching patterns (cache-aside, write-through, write-behind, refresh-ahead).
2.  **Cache Invalidation:** Implement sophisticated cache invalidation strategies (TTL, event-based, manual).
3.  **Multi-Level Caching:** Implement caching at multiple levels (application, database, CDN).
4.  **Cache Warming:** Learn about cache warming strategies to improve cold start performance.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Implement advanced caching strategies in your application, optimizing performance significantly.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Advanced caching strategies can dramatically improve application performance. Understanding different caching patterns enables you to choose the right approach for each use case. Multi-level caching provides performance benefits at different layers of your application.

Cache invalidation is one of the hardest problems in computer science. Understanding different invalidation strategies helps you maintain cache consistency while maximizing performance benefits.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand advanced caching strategies and patterns. You'll be able to implement multi-level caching, choose appropriate invalidation strategies, and optimize cache performance. This knowledge enables you to build highly performant applications.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Cache Pattern:** A strategy for how data is stored and retrieved from cache (cache-aside, write-through, etc.).
*   **Cache Invalidation:** Removing or updating cached data when source data changes.
*   **Multi-Level Caching:** Caching at multiple layers (application, database, CDN) for maximum performance.
*   **Cache Warming:** Pre-loading cache with frequently accessed data to improve performance.
*   **Cache Hit Rate:** The percentage of requests that are served from cache rather than the source.
