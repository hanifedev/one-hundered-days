# Day 52: Real-World Patterns - Clean Architecture

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understanding Clean Architecture:** Learn the principles of Clean Architecture (separation of concerns, dependency rule).
2.  **Layer Structure:** Understand the layers in Clean Architecture (domain, application, infrastructure, presentation).
3.  **Dependency Rule:** Learn how dependencies should flow in Clean Architecture (inward dependencies only).
4.  **NestJS Implementation:** Apply Clean Architecture principles to structure your NestJS application.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Refactor your application to follow Clean Architecture principles, organizing code into appropriate layers.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Clean Architecture organizes code into layers with clear boundaries and dependency rules. This makes applications more maintainable, testable, and independent of frameworks and databases. Understanding Clean Architecture helps you build applications that can evolve and adapt over time.

Applying Clean Architecture to NestJS involves organizing modules, services, and entities into layers that follow dependency rules. This structure makes it easier to test, maintain, and modify applications.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand Clean Architecture principles and how to apply them in NestJS applications. You'll be able to organize code into layers with clear boundaries and dependencies. This knowledge enables you to build maintainable, testable applications.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Clean Architecture:** An architectural approach that organizes code into layers with clear boundaries and dependency rules.
*   **Dependency Rule:** The principle that dependencies should point inward (toward the domain layer).
*   **Domain Layer:** The innermost layer containing business logic and entities.
*   **Application Layer:** The layer containing use cases and application-specific logic.
*   **Infrastructure Layer:** The outermost layer containing framework and database code.
