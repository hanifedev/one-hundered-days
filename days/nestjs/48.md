# Day 48: Testing Advanced - Mocking Strategies

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Advanced Mocking:** Learn advanced mocking techniques for complex scenarios (partial mocks, spy objects, mock factories).
2.  **Dependency Mocking:** Understand how to mock dependencies effectively (services, repositories, external APIs).
3.  **Mock Data Factories:** Create factories for generating mock data consistently across tests.
4.  **Mock Verification:** Learn how to verify that mocks were called correctly with the right parameters.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Refactor existing tests to use advanced mocking strategies and improve test maintainability.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Advanced mocking enables you to test complex scenarios and isolate units of code effectively. Understanding different mocking strategies helps you write tests that are maintainable and accurately reflect real behavior. Mock factories make it easy to generate consistent test data.

Proper mocking is essential for unit testing—it allows you to test code in isolation without depending on external systems. Understanding when and how to mock effectively is a key testing skill.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand advanced mocking strategies and techniques. You'll be able to create maintainable mocks, use mock factories, and verify mock behavior. This knowledge enables you to write effective, maintainable tests.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Mock:** A fake implementation of a dependency used for testing.
*   **Spy:** A mock that records how it was called, allowing verification of interactions.
*   **Mock Factory:** A function that creates mock objects with consistent, configurable properties.
*   **Partial Mock:** A mock that implements some methods while delegating others to the real implementation.
*   **Mock Verification:** Checking that mocks were called with expected parameters and the correct number of times.
