# Day 27: Database Advanced - Transactions

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understanding Transactions:** Learn what database transactions are and why they're important for data integrity.
2.  **Transaction Basics:** Implement basic transactions using TypeORM's transaction API.
3.  **Query Runner:** Use QueryRunner for more control over transactions.
4.  **Transaction Isolation Levels:** Understand different transaction isolation levels and when to use each.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Implement a feature that requires multiple database operations to succeed or fail together (e.g., transferring money between accounts).

## 📖 Task Explanations

Transactions ensure that multiple database operations either all succeed or all fail together, maintaining data integrity. This is crucial for operations like transferring money, where debiting one account and crediting another must happen atomically.

Understanding transactions is essential for building reliable applications that handle complex operations correctly. TypeORM provides several ways to work with transactions, from simple to advanced.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand how to use transactions in TypeORM. You'll be able to ensure data integrity for complex operations and handle transaction rollbacks appropriately. This knowledge enables you to build reliable, production-ready applications.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Transaction:** A sequence of database operations that are executed as a single unit (all succeed or all fail).
*   **ACID Properties:** Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability—properties that guarantee reliable database transactions.
*   **Rollback:** Reverting all changes made during a transaction if an error occurs.
*   **Commit:** Finalizing a transaction, making all changes permanent.
*   **Isolation Level:** The degree to which transactions are isolated from each other, preventing data inconsistencies.
