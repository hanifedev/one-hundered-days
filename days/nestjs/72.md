# Day 72: Enterprise Patterns - Circuit Breaker Pattern

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understanding Circuit Breaker:** Learn what the Circuit Breaker pattern is and why it's important (preventing cascading failures).
2.  **Circuit Breaker States:** Understand circuit breaker states (closed, open, half-open) and transitions.
3.  **Implementation:** Implement a circuit breaker in your NestJS application using libraries like `@nestjs/terminus` or custom implementation.
4.  **Fallback Strategies:** Implement fallback strategies when the circuit is open.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Add circuit breakers to external service calls and handle failures gracefully.

## 📖 Task Explanations

The Circuit Breaker pattern prevents cascading failures by stopping requests to failing services. When a service is failing, the circuit opens and requests fail fast, preventing resource exhaustion. This is essential for building resilient distributed systems.

Understanding circuit breakers enables you to build applications that gracefully handle service failures. It's a critical pattern for microservices and distributed systems.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand the Circuit Breaker pattern and how to implement it in NestJS. You'll be able to prevent cascading failures and handle service outages gracefully. This knowledge enables you to build resilient, production-ready applications.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Circuit Breaker:** A pattern that prevents requests to failing services, stopping cascading failures.
*   **Cascading Failure:** A failure in one service causing failures in dependent services.
*   **Fail Fast:** Failing immediately instead of waiting for timeouts when a service is known to be down.
*   **Fallback:** An alternative response when the primary service is unavailable.
*   **Resilience:** The ability of a system to handle and recover from failures.
