## 📖 Task Explanations

Migrations are version control for your database schema. They allow you to track changes to your database structure over time and apply those changes consistently across different environments (development, staging, production). Migrations are essential for team collaboration and production deployments.

Understanding migrations enables you to manage database schema changes safely and consistently. This is a critical skill for professional backend development.
