# Day 38: Production & Deployment - Monitoring and Logging

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Application Monitoring:** Learn about application monitoring and why it's important for production applications.
2.  **Structured Logging:** Implement structured logging using libraries like Winston or Pino.
3.  **Log Levels:** Understand different log levels (debug, info, warn, error) and when to use each.
4.  **Error Tracking:** Set up error tracking and monitoring (e.g., Sentry) for production applications.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring in your NestJS application.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Monitoring and logging are essential for understanding application behavior in production. Structured logging makes it easier to search and analyze logs. Error tracking helps identify and fix issues quickly. These tools are crucial for maintaining reliable production applications.

Understanding monitoring and logging enables you to diagnose issues, understand user behavior, and maintain application health. This is essential for professional backend development.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand how to implement monitoring and logging in NestJS applications. You'll be able to set up structured logging, error tracking, and application monitoring. This knowledge enables you to maintain and debug production applications effectively.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers
