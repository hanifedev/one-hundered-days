# Day 66: Advanced Topics - Disaster Recovery and Backup

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Disaster Recovery:** Learn what disaster recovery is and why it's critical (business continuity, data protection, RTO/RPO).
2.  **Explore Backup Strategies:** Learn about backup strategies: full backups, incremental backups, snapshots, replication.
3.  **Set Up Automated Backups:** Configure automated backups for databases (RDS snapshots) and storage (S3 versioning, EBS snapshots).
4.  **Understand Recovery Procedures:** Learn about recovery procedures: restore from backup, failover to secondary region, data recovery.
5.  **Practice Backup and Restore:** Create backups and practice restoring from them to verify your recovery procedures work.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn about disaster recovery and backup, which are essential for protecting data and ensuring business continuity. Disasters can be natural (fires, floods) or technical (data corruption, cyber attacks).

Disaster recovery concepts:
- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective):** Maximum acceptable downtime
- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective):** Maximum acceptable data loss
- **Backup:** Copies of data for recovery
- **Replication:** Real-time copying of data to another location
- **Failover:** Switching to a backup system automatically

Backup strategies:
- **Full backup:** Complete copy of all data
- **Incremental backup:** Only changed data since last backup
- **Snapshots:** Point-in-time copies of volumes or databases
- **Versioning:** Keeping multiple versions of files

You'll set up automated backups:
- **RDS:** Automated database snapshots
- **S3:** Versioning and lifecycle policies
- **EBS:** Volume snapshots
- **Cross-region replication:** Backup to another region

You'll practice recovery:
- Restore from backups
- Test failover procedures
- Verify data integrity

Understanding disaster recovery is crucial for production systems.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand disaster recovery and be able to set up automated backups and recovery procedures. You'll know how to protect data and ensure business continuity. This knowledge is essential for maintaining reliable production systems.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Disaster Recovery (DR):** The process of recovering IT systems and data after a disaster to ensure business continuity.
*   **RTO (Recovery Time Objective):** The maximum acceptable time to restore systems after a disaster.
*   **RPO (Recovery Point Objective):** The maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time.
*   **Backup:** A copy of data stored separately from the original, used for recovery purposes.
*   **Snapshot:** A point-in-time copy of a volume, database, or system state.
*   **Failover:** The automatic or manual switching to a backup system when the primary system fails.
