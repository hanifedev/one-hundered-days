# Day 83: Advanced Monitoring - Advanced Prometheus and Grafana

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Review Prometheus Basics:** Review what you learned about Prometheus (metrics, PromQL, scraping).
2.  **Learn Advanced PromQL:** Learn advanced PromQL features: functions, aggregations, subqueries, recording rules.
3.  **Set Up Recording Rules:** Create recording rules to pre-compute frequently used queries for better performance.
4.  **Create Advanced Grafana Dashboards:** Build complex Grafana dashboards with multiple data sources, variables, and advanced visualizations.
5.  **Set Up Alerting:** Configure Prometheus alerting rules and integrate with Alertmanager for notifications.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll dive deeper into Prometheus and Grafana, learning advanced features that are essential for production monitoring setups.

Advanced PromQL:
- **Functions:** `rate()`, `increase()`, `histogram_quantile()`, etc.
- **Aggregations:** `sum()`, `avg()`, `max()`, `by` clause
- **Subqueries:** Nested queries for complex analysis
- **Recording rules:** Pre-compute expensive queries

Recording rules:
- Improve query performance
- Reduce load on Prometheus
- Create reusable metrics
- Enable faster dashboards

Advanced Grafana:
- **Variables:** Dynamic dashboards that change based on variables
- **Multiple data sources:** Combine Prometheus, logs, traces
- **Advanced visualizations:** Heatmaps, histograms, custom panels
- **Dashboard templating:** Reusable dashboard templates

Alerting:
- **Alert rules:** Define conditions that trigger alerts
- **Alertmanager:** Routes alerts to different channels
- **Notification channels:** Email, Slack, PagerDuty, etc.
- **Alert grouping:** Group related alerts together

You'll practice these advanced features to build production-ready monitoring.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand advanced Prometheus and Grafana features. You'll be able to write complex PromQL queries, create sophisticated dashboards, and set up comprehensive alerting. This knowledge enables you to build production-ready monitoring solutions.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Advanced PromQL:** Complex Prometheus queries using functions, aggregations, and subqueries for sophisticated analysis.
*   **Recording Rule:** A pre-computed Prometheus query stored as a new metric, improving performance and enabling faster queries.
*   **Alertmanager:** A component that handles alerts from Prometheus, routes them to notification channels, and groups/silences alerts.
*   **Alert Rule:** A Prometheus configuration that defines conditions (metrics thresholds) that trigger alerts.
*   **Dashboard Variables:** Dynamic values in Grafana dashboards that allow users to filter or change what's displayed.
*   **Multi-Data Source Dashboard:** A Grafana dashboard that combines data from multiple sources (Prometheus, logs, traces).
