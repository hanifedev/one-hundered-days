## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Set Up Azure Account:** Create a free Azure account and understand the Azure Free Tier.
2.  **Navigate Azure Portal:** Explore the Azure Portal and understand its layout and navigation.
3.  **Understand Core Azure Services:** Learn about fundamental Azure services: Virtual Machines, Blob Storage, Azure Functions, Resource Groups.
4.  **Create Azure Resources:** Create basic Azure resources (a Virtual Machine or Storage Account) using the Azure Portal.
5.  **Compare with AWS:** Compare Azure services with their AWS equivalents to understand similarities and differences.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn about Microsoft Azure, which is the second-largest cloud provider after AWS. Understanding multiple cloud platforms makes you more versatile and valuable as a DevOps professional.

Azure core concepts:
- **Resource Groups:** Containers for organizing related resources
- **Virtual Machines:** Azure's compute service (equivalent to EC2)
- **Blob Storage:** Object storage (equivalent to S3)
- **Azure Functions:** Serverless compute (equivalent to Lambda)
- **App Service:** Platform-as-a-Service for web apps

You'll explore the Azure Portal, which is the web interface for managing Azure resources. Understanding the portal layout will help you navigate and find services.

You'll create basic resources to get hands-on experience:
- Create a Resource Group
- Create a Virtual Machine or Storage Account
- Understand Azure's resource model

You'll compare Azure with AWS:
- Similar services with different names
- Different approaches to some concepts
- Understanding both makes you cloud-agnostic

This knowledge expands your cloud expertise beyond AWS.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have an Azure account set up and be familiar with Azure fundamentals. You'll understand core Azure services and how they compare to AWS. This knowledge expands your cloud expertise and makes you more versatile.
