# Day 85: Advanced Monitoring - Practice Project & Review

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Project Goal:** Set up a complete observability stack for an application (metrics, logs, traces, APM).
2.  **Implement Metrics:** Set up Prometheus and Grafana for metrics collection and visualization.
3.  **Implement Logging:** Set up centralized logging (ELK or Loki) for log aggregation and analysis.
4.  **Implement Tracing (Optional):** Set up distributed tracing (Jaeger) if applicable for your application.
5.  **Create Comprehensive Dashboards:** Build dashboards that combine metrics, logs, and traces for full observability.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll apply everything you've learned about advanced monitoring by setting up a complete observability stack. This hands-on project will solidify your understanding and give you practical experience.

Set up complete observability:
- **Metrics:** Prometheus + Grafana for system and application metrics
- **Logs:** ELK Stack or Loki for centralized logging
- **Traces:** Jaeger or similar for distributed tracing (if applicable)
- **APM:** Application Performance Monitoring (if applicable)

Create comprehensive dashboards:
- **System dashboards:** Infrastructure metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- **Application dashboards:** Application metrics (request rate, latency, errors)
- **Log dashboards:** Log analysis and visualization
- **Business dashboards:** Business metrics if applicable

Set up alerting:
- **Metrics-based alerts:** Alert on thresholds (high CPU, error rate)
- **Log-based alerts:** Alert on log patterns (errors, security events)
- **Notification channels:** Email, Slack, PagerDuty

Integrate everything:
- Correlate metrics, logs, and traces
- Use dashboard variables for flexibility
- Set up alerting rules
- Document your observability setup

This project will give you real-world experience with complete observability.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have set up a complete observability stack. You'll have practical experience with metrics, logs, traces, and APM. This project demonstrates your ability to implement full observability, a critical DevOps skill.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Complete Observability Stack:** A monitoring setup that includes metrics, logs, traces, and APM for full visibility into systems.
*   **Full Observability:** The ability to understand system behavior through metrics, logs, and traces, enabling rapid issue detection and resolution.
*   **Observability Dashboard:** A dashboard that combines metrics, logs, and traces to provide comprehensive system visibility.
*   **Integrated Monitoring:** Monitoring solutions that work together, allowing correlation between metrics, logs, and traces.
*   **Production Observability:** A complete observability setup appropriate for production environments, with proper alerting and documentation.
