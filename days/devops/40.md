# Day 40: Monitoring & Logging - Practice Project & Review

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Project Goal:** Set up monitoring and logging for an application (e.g., a web application or API).
2.  **Set Up Prometheus:** Install and configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from your application.
3.  **Create Grafana Dashboards:** Create dashboards in Grafana to visualize key metrics (CPU, memory, request rate, error rate).
4.  **Configure Logging:** Set up centralized logging for your application (using ELK, Loki, or a cloud solution).
5.  **Set Up Alerts:** Configure alerts for critical metrics (high error rate, high CPU usage, service down).

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll apply everything you've learned about monitoring and logging by setting up a complete observability solution for an application. This hands-on project will solidify your understanding.

Set up monitoring:
- Install Prometheus
- Configure it to scrape metrics from your application
- Create Grafana dashboards showing:
  - System metrics (CPU, memory, disk)
  - Application metrics (request rate, response time, error rate)
  - Business metrics (if applicable)

Set up logging:
- Configure your application to write structured logs
- Set up log aggregation (ELK, Loki, or cloud solution)
- Create log queries and visualizations

Set up alerting:
- Define alert rules for critical metrics
- Configure notification channels (email, Slack, PagerDuty)
- Test alerts to ensure they work

This project will give you real-world experience with observability, which is essential for maintaining production systems.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have set up a complete monitoring and logging solution for an application. You'll have practical experience with Prometheus, Grafana, and centralized logging. This project demonstrates your ability to implement observability, a critical DevOps skill.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Observability Stack:** A complete set of tools (Prometheus, Grafana, logging solution) that provide full observability into a system.
*   **Production Monitoring:** Monitoring setup that provides visibility into production systems, enabling rapid issue detection and resolution.
*   **Alert Configuration:** Setting up rules and notification channels for alerting when metrics exceed thresholds or errors occur.
*   **Structured Logging:** Writing logs in a structured format (JSON) that makes them easier to parse, search, and analyze.
*   **Full-Stack Observability:** Complete visibility into systems through metrics, logs, and traces, enabling comprehensive understanding of system behavior.
