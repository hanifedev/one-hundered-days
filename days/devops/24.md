# Day 24: Cloud Computing - IAM and Security Basics

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand IAM:** Learn what IAM is and why it's critical for AWS security (managing users, permissions, access control).
2.  **Explore IAM Concepts:** Understand users, groups, roles, and policies in IAM.
3.  **Create an IAM User:** Create a new IAM user (not using the root account) for better security practices.
4.  **Create IAM Policies:** Write a simple IAM policy (JSON) to grant specific permissions.
5.  **Attach Policies:** Attach policies to users or groups and understand the principle of least privilege.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn about IAM, which is fundamental to AWS security. IAM controls who can access what in your AWS account. Proper IAM configuration is crucial for security and is a core DevOps responsibility.

IAM concepts:
- **Users:** Individual people or applications that need access
- **Groups:** Collections of users with similar permissions
- **Roles:** Temporary credentials for services or users
- **Policies:** JSON documents that define permissions

You'll create an IAM user instead of using the root account. This is a security best practice—the root account should rarely be used. IAM users can have specific permissions, making it easier to manage access and audit who did what.

You'll write IAM policies, which are JSON documents that define what actions are allowed or denied. Policies follow the principle of least privilege—granting only the minimum permissions needed.

Understanding IAM is essential for managing access in AWS and is a critical skill for DevOps professionals.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand IAM and be able to create users, write policies, and manage access in AWS. You'll understand security best practices and the principle of least privilege. This knowledge is essential for securing cloud infrastructure.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **IAM (Identity and Access Management):** AWS service for managing user access and permissions to AWS resources.
*   **IAM User:** An identity in AWS that represents a person or application and can have specific permissions.
*   **IAM Policy:** A JSON document that defines permissions (what actions are allowed or denied on which resources).
*   **IAM Group:** A collection of IAM users, useful for managing permissions for multiple users at once.
*   **IAM Role:** A set of permissions that can be assumed by users, applications, or AWS services temporarily.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** A security best practice of granting only the minimum permissions necessary to perform a task.
*   **Root Account:** The original AWS account with full access. Should be protected and rarely used.
