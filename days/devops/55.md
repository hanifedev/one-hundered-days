# Day 55: Security - Practice Project & Review

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Project Goal:** Secure an application infrastructure following security best practices.
2.  **Implement Secrets Management:** Set up secrets management for sensitive data (database passwords, API keys).
3.  **Add Vulnerability Scanning:** Integrate vulnerability scanning into your CI/CD pipeline.
4.  **Harden Infrastructure:** Harden your infrastructure (security groups, network configuration, encryption).
5.  **Document Security:** Document your security setup, including security controls, access policies, and compliance considerations.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll apply everything you've learned about security by securing a complete application infrastructure. This hands-on project will solidify your understanding and give you practical security experience.

Secure your infrastructure:
- **Secrets management:** Store all sensitive data in a secrets management solution
- **Vulnerability scanning:** Scan containers, dependencies, and infrastructure
- **Network security:** Configure security groups, network segmentation
- **Access control:** Implement least privilege access
- **Encryption:** Encrypt data at rest and in transit
- **Monitoring:** Set up security monitoring and alerting

Integrate security into CI/CD:
- Scan code and dependencies on every commit
- Scan container images before deployment
- Fail builds if critical vulnerabilities are found
- Use secrets from secrets management in pipelines

Document your security:
- Security architecture
- Access controls and policies
- Compliance considerations
- Incident response procedures

This project will give you real-world experience implementing security in DevOps.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have secured an application infrastructure following security best practices. You'll have practical experience with secrets management, vulnerability scanning, infrastructure hardening, and security integration. This project demonstrates your ability to build secure systems, a critical DevOps skill.
