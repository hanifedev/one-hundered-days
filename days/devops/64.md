# Day 64: Serverless - Serverless Framework and Deployment

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Serverless Framework:** Learn what the Serverless Framework is and why it's useful (simplifying serverless deployment, multi-cloud support).
2.  **Install Serverless Framework:** Install the Serverless Framework CLI tool.
3.  **Create a Serverless Project:** Create a new serverless project with the framework.
4.  **Configure serverless.yml:** Write a `serverless.yml` configuration file defining functions, events, and resources.
5.  **Deploy Serverless Application:** Deploy your serverless application using the framework and verify it works.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn about the Serverless Framework, which simplifies building and deploying serverless applications. While you can deploy serverless functions manually, frameworks make it much easier and more maintainable.

Serverless Framework benefits:
- **Simplified deployment:** Deploy entire serverless applications with one command
- **Multi-cloud:** Support for AWS, Azure, GCP, and more
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Define everything in YAML
- **Local development:** Test functions locally
- **Plugin ecosystem:** Extend functionality with plugins

You'll create a serverless project:
- Initialize a new project
- Understand the project structure
- Configure `serverless.yml`

The `serverless.yml` file defines:
- **Functions:** Your Lambda functions
- **Events:** Triggers for functions (HTTP, S3, etc.)
- **Resources:** Additional AWS resources (S3 buckets, DynamoDB tables)
- **Plugins:** Framework extensions
- **Environment variables:** Configuration values

You'll deploy your application:
- `serverless deploy` to deploy everything
- `serverless invoke` to test functions
- `serverless remove` to clean up

This hands-on experience will help you understand serverless development workflows.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand the Serverless Framework and be able to create and deploy serverless applications using it. You'll know how to structure serverless projects and use the framework for deployment. This knowledge enables you to build and deploy serverless applications efficiently.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Serverless Framework:** An open-source framework for building and deploying serverless applications across multiple cloud providers.
*   **serverless.yml:** The configuration file used by the Serverless Framework to define functions, events, and resources.
*   **Serverless Project:** A serverless application structured for use with the Serverless Framework.
*   **Serverless Deployment:** The process of deploying serverless applications using the Serverless Framework.
*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Defining infrastructure (functions, APIs, resources) in code (YAML) rather than manually.
*   **Serverless Plugin:** An extension to the Serverless Framework that adds additional functionality.
