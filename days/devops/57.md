# Day 57: Advanced CI/CD - Multi-Stage Pipelines

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Multi-Stage Pipelines:** Learn what multi-stage pipelines are and why they're useful (separating concerns, conditional deployment).
2.  **Design Pipeline Stages:** Plan pipeline stages: build, test, security scan, deploy to staging, deploy to production.
3.  **Implement Stage Gates:** Add approval gates or conditions between stages (e.g., manual approval before production).
4.  **Use Environment-Specific Deployments:** Configure different deployment strategies for different environments.
5.  **Create a Multi-Stage Pipeline:** Build a complete multi-stage pipeline with proper stage separation and gates.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn about multi-stage pipelines, which organize CI/CD workflows into logical stages. This makes pipelines more maintainable and allows for better control over deployments.

Multi-stage pipeline benefits:
- **Separation of concerns:** Each stage has a specific purpose
- **Conditional execution:** Run stages only when needed
- **Better control:** Manual approvals, rollbacks, environment-specific configs
- **Clear visibility:** Easy to see where a pipeline is and what failed

Typical pipeline stages:
- **Build:** Compile code, build artifacts
- **Test:** Run unit tests, integration tests
- **Security:** Vulnerability scanning, security checks
- **Deploy to Staging:** Deploy to test environment
- **Integration Tests:** Run tests against staging
- **Deploy to Production:** Deploy to production (with approval)

You'll implement stage gates:
- **Automatic gates:** Conditions that must be met (tests pass, no critical vulnerabilities)
- **Manual gates:** Human approval required (production deployments)
- **Environment gates:** Different requirements for different environments

You'll create a complete multi-stage pipeline that demonstrates proper organization and control.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand multi-stage pipelines and be able to design and implement them. You'll know how to organize pipelines into stages, add gates, and configure environment-specific deployments. This knowledge enables you to build sophisticated, production-ready CI/CD pipelines.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Multi-Stage Pipeline:** A CI/CD pipeline organized into distinct stages (build, test, deploy) with clear separation and control.
*   **Stage Gate:** A checkpoint between pipeline stages that must be passed (automatically or manually) before proceeding.
*   **Manual Approval:** A stage gate that requires human approval before continuing, often used for production deployments.
*   **Environment-Specific Deployment:** Different deployment configurations and strategies for different environments (dev, staging, prod).
*   **Pipeline Stage:** A distinct phase in a CI/CD pipeline with a specific purpose (build, test, deploy).
*   **Deployment Strategy:** The approach for deploying applications (blue-green, canary, rolling updates).
