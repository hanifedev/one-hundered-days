# Day 21: Cloud Computing - Introduction to AWS

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Cloud Computing:** Learn what cloud computing is and its benefits (scalability, cost-effectiveness, flexibility).
2.  **Explore Cloud Providers:** Learn about major cloud providers: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
3.  **Set Up AWS Account:** Create a free AWS account and understand the AWS Free Tier.
4.  **Navigate AWS Console:** Explore the AWS Management Console and understand its layout.
5.  **Understand Core AWS Services:** Learn about fundamental AWS services: EC2 (compute), S3 (storage), IAM (security).

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll be introduced to cloud computing, which is essential in modern DevOps. Cloud computing provides on-demand computing resources over the internet, eliminating the need to manage physical servers.

You'll learn about the major cloud providers:
- **AWS (Amazon Web Services):** The largest cloud provider
- **Azure (Microsoft):** Popular for Microsoft-based environments
- **GCP (Google Cloud Platform):** Strong in data and analytics

We'll focus on AWS as it's the most widely used. You'll create a free AWS account, which includes the Free Tier—free access to many AWS services for 12 months (with usage limits).

You'll explore the AWS Management Console, the web interface for managing AWS resources. Understanding the console layout will help you navigate and find services.

You'll also learn about core AWS services that form the foundation of most cloud architectures:
- **EC2:** Virtual servers in the cloud
- **S3:** Object storage service
- **IAM:** Identity and access management

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand cloud computing and have an AWS account set up. You'll be familiar with the AWS console and know about core AWS services. This foundation is essential for working with cloud infrastructure in DevOps.
