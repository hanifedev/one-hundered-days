# Day 48: Configuration Management - Ansible Roles and Best Practices

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Roles:** Learn what Ansible roles are and why they're useful (organization, reusability, sharing).
2.  **Create a Role:** Create your first Ansible role with proper directory structure (tasks, handlers, templates, vars).
3.  **Use Roles in Playbooks:** Use roles in playbooks to organize and reuse configuration code.
4.  **Explore Role Structure:** Understand role directory structure: tasks, handlers, templates, vars, defaults, files.
5.  **Follow Best Practices:** Learn Ansible best practices: use roles, organize code, use variables, document playbooks.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn about Ansible roles, which are a way to organize and reuse playbook code. Roles make Ansible code more maintainable and shareable.

Roles provide:
- **Organization:** Group related tasks together
- **Reusability:** Use the same role in multiple playbooks
- **Sharing:** Share roles via Ansible Galaxy
- **Modularity:** Break complex playbooks into manageable pieces

Role structure:
- **tasks/main.yml:** Main tasks for the role
- **handlers/main.yml:** Handlers used by the role
- **templates/:** Jinja2 templates for configuration files
- **vars/main.yml:** Role variables
- **defaults/main.yml:** Default variable values
- **files/:** Static files to copy

You'll create a role, perhaps for:
- Setting up a web server (Nginx, Apache)
- Configuring a database
- Installing and configuring an application

You'll use the role in a playbook, seeing how roles simplify and organize your automation code.

You'll also learn best practices for writing maintainable Ansible code.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand Ansible roles and be able to create and use them. You'll know how to organize Ansible code effectively and follow best practices. This knowledge enables you to write maintainable, reusable configuration management code.
