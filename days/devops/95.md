# Day 95: Advanced Security - Practice Project & Review

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Project Goal:** Implement comprehensive security for an application infrastructure (security automation, compliance, Zero Trust principles).
2.  **Implement Security Automation:** Set up automated vulnerability scanning and security compliance checking.
3.  **Apply Zero Trust Principles:** Design and implement Zero Trust architecture for your infrastructure.
4.  **Create Incident Response Plan:** Document a complete incident response plan for your infrastructure.
5.  **Document Security Posture:** Document your security setup, including controls, monitoring, and procedures.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll apply everything you've learned about advanced security by implementing comprehensive security for an application infrastructure. This hands-on project will solidify your understanding and give you practical security experience.

Implement comprehensive security:
- **Security automation:** Automated scanning, compliance checking
- **Zero Trust architecture:** Identity-based security, network segmentation
- **Monitoring:** Security monitoring and alerting
- **Incident response:** Plans and procedures
- **Documentation:** Security documentation

Implement security automation:
- Vulnerability scanning in CI/CD
- Automated compliance checking
- Security policy enforcement
- Security reporting

Apply Zero Trust principles:
- Strong IAM policies
- Network segmentation
- Continuous verification
- Least privilege access
- Encryption everywhere

Create incident response plan:
- Detection procedures
- Containment procedures
- Recovery procedures
- Communication plan
- Roles and responsibilities

Document security:
- Security architecture
- Security controls
- Monitoring setup
- Incident response procedures
- Compliance status

This project will give you real-world experience with comprehensive security.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have implemented comprehensive security for an infrastructure. You'll have practical experience with security automation, Zero Trust architecture, and incident response. This project demonstrates your ability to build secure systems, a critical DevOps skill.
