# Day 26: Infrastructure as Code - Introduction to Terraform

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand IaC:** Learn what Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is and why it's important (version control, reproducibility, consistency).
2.  **Explore IaC Tools:** Learn about popular IaC tools: Terraform, CloudFormation, Ansible, Pulumi.
3.  **Install Terraform:** Install Terraform on your local machine.
4.  **Understand Terraform Concepts:** Learn about Terraform's core concepts: providers, resources, state, and configuration files.
5.  **Write Your First Configuration:** Create a simple Terraform configuration file (`.tf`) that defines a basic resource.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll be introduced to Infrastructure as Code (IaC), which is a fundamental DevOps practice. IaC allows you to define and manage infrastructure using code, rather than manually configuring resources.

Benefits of IaC:
- **Version Control:** Infrastructure changes are tracked in Git
- **Reproducibility:** Same code creates the same infrastructure
- **Consistency:** Eliminates manual configuration errors
- **Documentation:** Code serves as documentation

You'll learn about Terraform, which is one of the most popular IaC tools. Terraform uses a declarative language (HCL - HashiCorp Configuration Language) to define infrastructure.

Terraform concepts:
- **Providers:** Plugins that interact with cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- **Resources:** Infrastructure components (EC2 instances, S3 buckets, etc.)
- **State:** Terraform's record of what it has created
- **Configuration Files:** `.tf` files that define your infrastructure

You'll write your first Terraform configuration, which will define a simple resource. This hands-on experience will help you understand the basic structure.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand Infrastructure as Code and have Terraform installed. You'll be familiar with Terraform concepts and able to write basic configuration files. This foundation is essential for managing infrastructure as code, a core DevOps practice.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** The practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure through code instead of manual processes.
*   **Terraform:** An open-source IaC tool by HashiCorp that uses declarative configuration files to manage infrastructure.
*   **Provider:** A plugin in Terraform that interacts with a specific cloud provider or service (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.).
*   **Resource:** A component of infrastructure defined in Terraform (e.g., an EC2 instance, S3 bucket).
*   **Terraform State:** A file that tracks the resources Terraform has created and their current state.
*   **HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language):** The configuration language used by Terraform to define infrastructure.
