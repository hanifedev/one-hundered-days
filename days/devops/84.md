# Day 84: Advanced Monitoring - Log Aggregation and Analysis

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Review Centralized Logging:** Review what you learned about centralized logging (ELK Stack, Loki).
2.  **Set Up ELK Stack:** Install and configure Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana for log aggregation.
3.  **Configure Log Shipping:** Set up log shipping from applications to Elasticsearch (using Filebeat, Logstash, or direct shipping).
4.  **Create Log Queries:** Write Elasticsearch queries (or use Kibana) to search and analyze logs.
5.  **Set Up Log-Based Alerts:** Configure alerts based on log patterns (e.g., error rate, specific error messages).

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll dive deeper into log aggregation and analysis, setting up a complete logging solution. Logs are crucial for debugging, auditing, and understanding system behavior.

ELK Stack components:
- **Elasticsearch:** Stores and indexes logs for fast searching
- **Logstash:** Processes and transforms logs before storing
- **Kibana:** Visualizes and searches logs through a web interface
- **Filebeat:** Lightweight log shipper (alternative to Logstash)

You'll set up the ELK Stack:
- Install Elasticsearch (or use managed service)
- Configure Logstash or Filebeat to ship logs
- Set up Kibana for visualization
- Configure log parsing and indexing

You'll configure log shipping:
- From applications to log aggregator
- Parse structured logs (JSON)
- Add metadata (hostname, timestamp, etc.)
- Handle different log formats

You'll create log queries:
- Search logs by text, time range, fields
- Filter by log level, service, host
- Aggregate logs (count errors, group by service)
- Create visualizations in Kibana

You'll set up log-based alerts:
- Alert on error patterns
- Alert on high error rates
- Alert on specific log messages
- Integrate with notification systems

This knowledge is essential for production logging.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to set up and use the ELK Stack for log aggregation and analysis. You'll know how to ship logs, query them, and set up log-based alerts. This knowledge enables you to build comprehensive logging solutions.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **ELK Stack:** A combination of Elasticsearch (storage), Logstash (processing), and Kibana (visualization) for log aggregation and analysis.
*   **Log Shipping:** The process of sending logs from applications to a centralized log aggregation system.
*   **Elasticsearch Query:** A search query written in Elasticsearch's query language to find and analyze logs.
*   **Log Parsing:** Extracting structured data (fields) from unstructured log messages for better searching and analysis.
*   **Log-Based Alerting:** Triggering alerts based on patterns or conditions found in log messages.
*   **Structured Logging:** Writing logs in a structured format (JSON) that makes them easier to parse, search, and analyze.
