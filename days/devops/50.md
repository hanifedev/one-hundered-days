# Day 50: Configuration Management - Practice Project & Review

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Project Goal:** Create a complete automation solution using Ansible (provision infrastructure, configure servers, deploy application).
2.  **Organize with Roles:** Structure your automation using Ansible roles for better organization.
3.  **Use Variables:** Make your playbooks flexible using variables for different environments (dev, prod).
4.  **Provision and Configure:** Use Ansible to both provision cloud resources and configure them.
5.  **Document Your Automation:** Document your Ansible setup, including how to use it, what it does, and variable descriptions.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll apply everything you've learned about Ansible by creating a complete automation solution. This hands-on project will solidify your understanding and give you practical configuration management experience.

Create a complete automation solution:
- **Infrastructure provisioning:** Create cloud resources (EC2, S3, etc.)
- **Server configuration:** Configure servers (install software, set up services)
- **Application deployment:** Deploy your application
- **All automated:** Everything runs from Ansible playbooks

Organize your code:
- Use roles to organize related tasks
- Use variables to make playbooks flexible
- Support multiple environments (dev, staging, prod)

Your solution should:
- Provision infrastructure (EC2 instances, security groups, etc.)
- Configure servers (install dependencies, configure services)
- Deploy applications
- Be reusable and maintainable

Document everything:
- What the automation does
- How to use it (ansible-playbook commands)
- Variable descriptions
- Role descriptions

This project will give you real-world experience with configuration management, which is essential for managing infrastructure at scale.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have created a complete automation solution using Ansible. You'll have practical experience with roles, variables, cloud modules, and best practices. This project demonstrates your ability to automate infrastructure and application deployment, a fundamental DevOps skill.
