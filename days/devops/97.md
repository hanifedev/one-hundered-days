# Day 97: Final Projects - Capstone Project Implementation (Part 1)

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Implement Infrastructure:** Create complete infrastructure using Terraform (VPC, compute, storage, networking, security).
2.  **Set Up CI/CD:** Implement a complete CI/CD pipeline with testing, security scanning, and deployment.
3.  **Configure Monitoring:** Set up comprehensive monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana, logging, alerting).
4.  **Implement Security:** Apply security best practices (secrets management, vulnerability scanning, compliance).
5.  **Document Progress:** Document what you've implemented and what's working.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll continue implementing your capstone project, building out the core components. This is where you'll apply all the skills you've learned.

Implement infrastructure:
- Use Terraform for all infrastructure
- Follow best practices (modules, variables, remote state)
- Implement security (VPC, security groups, IAM)
- Support multiple environments if applicable

Set up CI/CD:
- Complete pipeline (build, test, security scan, deploy)
- Multi-stage with proper gates
- Automated testing
- Security scanning integrated
- Deployment automation

Configure monitoring:
- Prometheus for metrics
- Grafana for visualization
- Centralized logging
- Alerting configured
- Dashboards created

Implement security:
- Secrets management
- Vulnerability scanning
- Compliance checking
- Security monitoring
- Incident response plan

Document progress:
- What's implemented
- What works
- What's next
- Architecture updates

Continue building your comprehensive DevOps project.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have made significant progress on your capstone project. You'll have infrastructure, CI/CD, monitoring, and security implemented. This demonstrates your ability to build complete DevOps solutions.
