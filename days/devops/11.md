# Day 11: Containerization - Introduction to Docker

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Containers:** Learn what containers are and why they're important in DevOps (consistency, portability, isolation).
2.  **Install Docker:** Install Docker on your local machine (Docker Desktop for Windows/Mac, or Docker Engine for Linux).
3.  **Verify Installation:** Run `docker --version` and `docker ps` to verify Docker is installed and running.
4.  **Understand Docker Concepts:** Learn key Docker concepts: images, containers, Dockerfile, and Docker Hub.
5.  **Run Your First Container:** Pull and run a simple container (e.g., `docker run hello-world`).

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today marks the beginning of your journey into containerization, a fundamental DevOps skill. Containers package applications with all their dependencies, ensuring they run consistently across different environments. This solves the "it works on my machine" problem and is essential for modern software deployment.

Docker is the most popular containerization platform. You'll install it and learn the basic concepts:
- **Images:** Read-only templates used to create containers
- **Containers:** Running instances of images
- **Dockerfile:** A text file with instructions for building images
- **Docker Hub:** A registry for sharing Docker images

You'll start by running a simple "hello-world" container to verify everything works. This hands-on experience will help you understand the basic Docker workflow.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand containers and Docker basics. You'll have Docker installed and be able to run simple containers. This foundation is essential for learning containerization, which is a core skill in modern DevOps practices.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Container:** A lightweight, standalone, executable package that includes everything needed to run an application (code, runtime, system tools, libraries, settings).
*   **Docker:** An open-source platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers.
*   **Image:** A read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container. Images are built from Dockerfiles.
*   **Container (instance):** A running instance of a Docker image. Containers are isolated from each other and the host system.
*   **Docker Hub:** A cloud-based registry service where you can find and share Docker images.
