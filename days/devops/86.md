# Day 86: Advanced Automation - Python for DevOps

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Python for DevOps:** Learn why Python is popular in DevOps (automation, scripting, cloud SDKs, infrastructure tools).
2.  **Review Python Basics:** Review Python fundamentals: variables, functions, modules, file I/O.
3.  **Learn Cloud SDKs:** Learn about cloud SDKs: boto3 (AWS), azure-sdk (Azure), google-cloud-python (GCP).
4.  **Write Cloud Automation Scripts:** Write Python scripts to automate cloud operations (create resources, manage instances, query APIs).
5.  **Practice with boto3:** Create scripts using boto3 to interact with AWS services programmatically.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn about using Python for DevOps automation. Python is one of the most popular languages in DevOps due to its simplicity and extensive libraries for cloud automation.

Python for DevOps use cases:
- **Cloud automation:** Interact with cloud APIs programmatically
- **Infrastructure scripts:** Automate infrastructure operations
- **Data processing:** Process logs, metrics, reports
- **API integration:** Integrate with various tools and services
- **Testing:** Write infrastructure tests

You'll learn about cloud SDKs:
- **boto3:** AWS SDK for Python (most popular)
- **azure-sdk:** Azure SDK for Python
- **google-cloud-python:** GCP SDK for Python

You'll write automation scripts:
- List and manage EC2 instances
- Create and manage S3 buckets
- Query CloudWatch metrics
- Automate common operations

You'll practice with boto3:
- Set up credentials
- Create clients for AWS services
- Make API calls
- Handle errors and exceptions
- Use pagination for large results

This knowledge enables you to automate cloud operations beyond what Infrastructure as Code tools provide.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand how to use Python for DevOps automation. You'll be able to write scripts that interact with cloud APIs and automate operations. This knowledge enables you to create custom automation solutions beyond standard tools.
