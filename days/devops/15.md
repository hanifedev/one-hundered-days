# Day 15: Containerization - Practice Project & Review

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Project Goal:** Containerize a simple application (e.g., a web app, API, or database-backed application).
2.  **Create Dockerfile:** Write a Dockerfile for your application, including all necessary dependencies and configuration.
3.  **Build and Test:** Build your Docker image and test it locally to ensure it works correctly.
4.  **Create docker-compose.yml:** If your app has multiple components (e.g., app + database), create a compose file to orchestrate them.
5.  **Document Your Setup:** Document your Docker setup, including how to build and run your containerized application.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll apply everything you've learned about Docker by containerizing a real application. This hands-on project will solidify your understanding and give you practical experience.

Choose a simple application to containerize. It could be:
- A simple web application (Python Flask, Node.js Express, etc.)
- An API service
- A database-backed application

Create a Dockerfile that:
- Uses an appropriate base image
- Installs dependencies
- Copies your application code
- Exposes necessary ports
- Defines the startup command

If your application needs a database or other services, create a `docker-compose.yml` file to orchestrate everything. This will give you experience with multi-container setups.

Test everything thoroughly. Make sure your containerized application works the same way it did before containerization. Document your setup so others (or future you) can understand how to use it.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have containerized a real application using Docker. You'll have practical experience creating Dockerfiles, building images, and orchestrating multi-container applications with Docker Compose. This project demonstrates your ability to containerize applications, a fundamental DevOps skill.
