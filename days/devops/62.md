# Day 62: Serverless - AWS Lambda Basics

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Create Your First Lambda Function:** Create a simple AWS Lambda function using the AWS Console or CLI.
2.  **Understand Function Configuration:** Learn about Lambda configuration: runtime, memory, timeout, environment variables.
3.  **Test Lambda Function:** Test your Lambda function using the AWS Console test feature.
4.  **Set Up Triggers:** Configure triggers for your Lambda function (API Gateway, S3 events, CloudWatch Events).
5.  **View Logs and Metrics:** Use CloudWatch to view Lambda logs and monitor function performance.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn to work with AWS Lambda, which is the most popular serverless platform. Lambda allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers.

You'll create your first Lambda function:
- Choose a runtime (Python, Node.js, Java, Go, etc.)
- Write function code
- Configure function settings (memory, timeout)
- Set up environment variables

Lambda configuration options:
- **Runtime:** Programming language and version
- **Memory:** Amount of memory allocated (affects CPU and cost)
- **Timeout:** Maximum execution time
- **Environment variables:** Configuration values
- **IAM role:** Permissions for the function

You'll set up triggers, which are events that invoke your function:
- **API Gateway:** HTTP requests
- **S3 events:** File uploads, deletions
- **CloudWatch Events:** Scheduled tasks
- **DynamoDB:** Database changes
- **SNS/SQS:** Message notifications

You'll use CloudWatch to monitor your functions:
- View logs
- Monitor metrics (invocations, errors, duration)
- Set up alarms

This hands-on experience will help you understand Lambda in practice.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to create and configure AWS Lambda functions. You'll know how to set up triggers, monitor functions, and understand Lambda configuration options. This knowledge enables you to build serverless applications on AWS.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **AWS Lambda Function:** A piece of code that runs in AWS Lambda in response to events.
*   **Lambda Runtime:** The programming language and version environment for executing Lambda functions.
*   **Lambda Trigger:** An event source that invokes a Lambda function (API Gateway, S3, CloudWatch, etc.).
*   **CloudWatch Logs:** AWS service for viewing and monitoring Lambda function logs.
*   **Lambda Execution:** A single invocation of a Lambda function, with associated metrics and logs.
*   **Serverless Function:** A function that runs in a serverless platform like AWS Lambda.
