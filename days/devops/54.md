# Day 54: Security - Infrastructure Security and Hardening

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Infrastructure Security:** Learn why infrastructure security is critical (securing servers, networks, cloud resources).
2.  **Learn Security Hardening:** Understand security hardening practices: disable unnecessary services, configure firewalls, apply patches.
3.  **Configure Security Groups:** Set up security groups (firewalls) properly in AWS or your cloud provider.
4.  **Implement Network Security:** Configure network segmentation, VPNs, and secure network communication.
5.  **Practice Hardening:** Harden a server or cloud resource following security best practices.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn about infrastructure security and hardening, which involves securing servers, networks, and cloud resources. Even with secure applications, vulnerable infrastructure can be exploited.

Infrastructure security includes:
- **Server hardening:** Securing operating systems and services
- **Network security:** Firewalls, network segmentation, VPNs
- **Cloud security:** Properly configuring cloud resources
- **Access control:** Limiting who can access what
- **Encryption:** Encrypting data at rest and in transit

Security hardening practices:
- **Principle of least privilege:** Grant minimum necessary permissions
- **Defense in depth:** Multiple layers of security
- **Regular patching:** Keep systems updated
- **Disable unnecessary services:** Reduce attack surface
- **Configure firewalls:** Control network traffic
- **Use encryption:** Protect data in transit and at rest

You'll practice hardening infrastructure:
- Configure security groups properly
- Set up network segmentation
- Apply security patches
- Configure encryption

This knowledge is essential for securing production infrastructure.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand infrastructure security and be able to harden servers and cloud resources. You'll know how to configure security groups, network security, and follow security best practices. This knowledge is crucial for building secure infrastructure.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Infrastructure Security:** The practice of securing servers, networks, and cloud resources to protect against attacks.
*   **Security Hardening:** The process of securing a system by reducing its attack surface and applying security best practices.
*   **Security Group:** A virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic for cloud resources (EC2, RDS, etc.).
*   **Network Segmentation:** Dividing a network into smaller segments to limit the impact of security breaches.
*   **Defense in Depth:** A security strategy that uses multiple layers of security controls.
*   **Attack Surface:** The total number of ways an attacker could potentially exploit a system.
