# Day 43: Advanced Cloud Services - Load Balancers

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Load Balancing:** Learn what load balancing is and why it's important (distributing traffic, high availability, scalability).
2.  **Explore AWS Load Balancers:** Learn about different AWS load balancer types: Application Load Balancer (ALB), Network Load Balancer (NLB), Classic Load Balancer.
3.  **Create an ALB:** Create an Application Load Balancer to distribute traffic across multiple EC2 instances.
4.  **Configure Target Groups:** Set up target groups and health checks for your load balancer.
5.  **Test Load Balancing:** Deploy multiple instances behind the load balancer and verify traffic distribution.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn about load balancers, which are essential for building scalable, highly available applications. Load balancers distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers, ensuring no single server is overwhelmed.

Load balancing benefits:
- **High availability:** If one server fails, traffic goes to healthy servers
- **Scalability:** Add more servers to handle increased load
- **Performance:** Distribute load evenly for better response times
- **SSL termination:** Handle SSL/TLS at the load balancer

AWS offers three types of load balancers:
- **Application Load Balancer (ALB):** Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS), best for web applications
- **Network Load Balancer (NLB):** Layer 4 (TCP/UDP), best for extreme performance
- **Classic Load Balancer:** Legacy option, being phased out

You'll create an ALB, which is the most common choice for web applications. You'll configure:
- **Target groups:** Groups of servers that receive traffic
- **Health checks:** Monitor server health and route traffic only to healthy servers
- **Listeners:** Rules for how traffic is routed

You'll deploy multiple EC2 instances and verify that the load balancer distributes traffic across them.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand load balancing and be able to create and configure AWS load balancers. You'll know how to set up target groups, health checks, and distribute traffic across multiple servers. This knowledge is essential for building scalable, highly available applications.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Load Balancer:** A device or service that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers.
*   **Application Load Balancer (ALB):** An AWS load balancer that operates at the application layer (HTTP/HTTPS) and provides advanced routing features.
*   **Target Group:** A group of servers (targets) that receive traffic from a load balancer.
*   **Health Check:** A mechanism that monitors server health and routes traffic only to healthy servers.
*   **Traffic Distribution:** The process of spreading incoming requests across multiple servers to balance load.
*   **High Availability:** A system design that ensures continuous operation even if individual components fail.
