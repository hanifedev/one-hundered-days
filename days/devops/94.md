# Day 94: Advanced Security - Security Incident Response

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Incident Response:** Learn what security incident response is and why it's critical (minimize damage, restore services, learn from incidents).
2.  **Explore Incident Response Process:** Learn about the incident response lifecycle: preparation, detection, containment, eradication, recovery, lessons learned.
3.  **Set Up Security Monitoring:** Configure security monitoring and alerting for incident detection.
4.  **Create Incident Response Plan:** Document an incident response plan with procedures and roles.
5.  **Practice Incident Response:** Simulate a security incident and practice the response procedures.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn about security incident response, which is essential for handling security breaches effectively. Even with good security, incidents happen—preparation is key.

Incident response lifecycle:
- **Preparation:** Set up monitoring, create plans, train team
- **Detection:** Identify security incidents quickly
- **Containment:** Limit the impact of incidents
- **Eradication:** Remove threats from systems
- **Recovery:** Restore services and systems
- **Lessons learned:** Improve based on incidents

You'll set up security monitoring:
- **SIEM:** Security Information and Event Management
- **Log analysis:** Monitor logs for security events
- **Anomaly detection:** Detect unusual behavior
- **Alerting:** Get notified of security events

You'll create an incident response plan:
- **Roles and responsibilities:** Who does what
- **Communication plan:** How to communicate during incidents
- **Containment procedures:** How to limit damage
- **Recovery procedures:** How to restore services
- **Escalation procedures:** When to escalate

You'll practice incident response:
- Simulate a security incident
- Follow incident response procedures
- Practice containment and recovery
- Document lessons learned

This knowledge enables you to handle security incidents effectively.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand security incident response and be able to create incident response plans and procedures. You'll know how to detect, contain, and recover from security incidents. This knowledge is essential for maintaining security resilience.
