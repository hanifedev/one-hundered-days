# Day 63: Serverless - API Gateway and Serverless APIs

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand API Gateway:** Learn what API Gateway is and its role in serverless architectures (HTTP API, REST API, WebSocket).
2.  **Create an API Gateway:** Create an API Gateway endpoint that triggers a Lambda function.
3.  **Configure Routes:** Set up API routes (GET, POST, etc.) and connect them to Lambda functions.
4.  **Test API Endpoints:** Test your API endpoints using curl, Postman, or a web browser.
5.  **Deploy API:** Deploy your API and understand stages (dev, prod) and API versioning.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn about API Gateway, which is essential for building serverless APIs. API Gateway provides a managed service for creating, publishing, and managing APIs.

API Gateway features:
- **HTTP endpoints:** Create RESTful or HTTP APIs
- **Request/response transformation:** Modify requests and responses
- **Authentication/authorization:** Integrate with AWS Cognito, API keys
- **Rate limiting:** Control API usage
- **Caching:** Cache responses for better performance
- **Stages:** Deploy APIs to different stages (dev, staging, prod)

You'll create an API Gateway that triggers Lambda functions:
- Define API routes (GET /users, POST /users, etc.)
- Connect routes to Lambda functions
- Configure request/response mapping
- Set up CORS if needed

You'll test your API:
- Use curl or Postman to make requests
- Verify Lambda functions are invoked
- Check responses and error handling

You'll deploy your API to stages, allowing you to have separate dev and production endpoints. Understanding API Gateway is crucial for building serverless APIs.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand API Gateway and be able to create serverless APIs. You'll know how to set up routes, connect to Lambda functions, and deploy APIs. This knowledge enables you to build complete serverless API solutions.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **API Gateway:** A managed service for creating, publishing, and managing APIs, often used with serverless functions.
*   **REST API:** An API that follows REST (Representational State Transfer) principles, using HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
*   **API Route:** A specific endpoint in an API (e.g., GET /users, POST /users).
*   **API Stage:** A named reference to a deployment of an API (dev, staging, prod) with its own configuration.
*   **Serverless API:** An API built using serverless functions (Lambda) and API Gateway, with no server management required.
*   **Request/Response Mapping:** Transforming requests and responses between API Gateway and Lambda functions.
