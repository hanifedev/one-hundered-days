# Day 12: Containerization - Docker Images and Containers

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Pull Images:** Use `docker pull` to download images from Docker Hub (e.g., `docker pull nginx`, `docker pull ubuntu`).
2.  **List Images:** Use `docker images` to see all images on your system.
3.  **Run Containers:** Use `docker run` with various options (`-d` for detached mode, `-p` for port mapping, `--name` for naming).
4.  **List Running Containers:** Use `docker ps` to see running containers and `docker ps -a` to see all containers.
5.  **Stop and Remove Containers:** Use `docker stop`, `docker start`, `docker rm` to manage container lifecycle.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll dive deeper into working with Docker images and containers. Understanding how to manage the lifecycle of containers is crucial for DevOps work.

You'll learn to:
- Pull images from registries (like Docker Hub)
- Run containers with different options
- Map ports so containers can be accessed from the host
- Run containers in detached mode (background)
- Manage container state (start, stop, remove)

Port mapping is particularly important—it allows you to access services running in containers from your host machine. For example, `-p 8080:80` maps port 8080 on your host to port 80 in the container.

You'll also learn the difference between running and stopped containers, and how to clean up containers you no longer need.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be comfortable working with Docker images and containers. You'll be able to pull images, run containers with various configurations, and manage their lifecycle. This knowledge is essential for deploying and managing containerized applications.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **`docker pull`:** Command to download an image from a registry (like Docker Hub).
*   **`docker images`:** Command to list all Docker images on your system.
*   **`docker run`:** Command to create and start a container from an image.
*   **Port Mapping:** Mapping a port on the host machine to a port in the container (e.g., `-p 8080:80`).
*   **Detached Mode (`-d`):** Running a container in the background, detached from the terminal.
*   **`docker ps`:** Command to list running containers.
*   **`docker stop`:** Command to stop a running container.
*   **`docker rm`:** Command to remove a container.
