# Day 36: Monitoring & Logging - Introduction to Observability

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Observability:** Learn what observability is and its three pillars: metrics, logs, and traces.
2.  **Understand Monitoring:** Learn why monitoring is critical in DevOps (detecting issues, performance optimization, capacity planning).
3.  **Explore Monitoring Tools:** Learn about popular monitoring tools: Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, New Relic, CloudWatch.
4.  **Understand Logging:** Learn why logging is important (debugging, auditing, troubleshooting).
5.  **Explore Logging Tools:** Learn about logging solutions: ELK Stack, Loki, CloudWatch Logs, Splunk.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll be introduced to observability, which is essential for understanding what's happening in your systems. Observability consists of three pillars:

**Metrics:** Numerical measurements over time (CPU usage, request rate, error rate)
- Help identify trends and anomalies
- Used for alerting and capacity planning

**Logs:** Text records of events (application logs, system logs, access logs)
- Help debug issues and understand what happened
- Provide audit trails

**Traces:** Request flows through distributed systems
- Help understand how requests flow through microservices
- Identify bottlenecks and dependencies

Monitoring is crucial because:
- You can't fix what you can't see
- Early detection prevents major issues
- Performance data helps optimize systems
- Capacity planning requires historical data

You'll learn about various tools available for monitoring and logging, each with different strengths and use cases.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand observability and why monitoring and logging are essential in DevOps. You'll be familiar with popular tools and understand the three pillars of observability. This foundation is crucial for maintaining reliable systems.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Observability:** The ability to understand the internal state of a system by examining its outputs (metrics, logs, traces).
*   **Monitoring:** The practice of collecting, analyzing, and using metrics to understand system health and performance.
*   **Metrics:** Numerical measurements collected over time (CPU usage, memory, request rate, error rate).
*   **Logs:** Text records of events that occurred in a system, useful for debugging and auditing.
*   **Traces:** Records of request flows through distributed systems, showing how requests move through services.
*   **Alerting:** Notifications triggered when metrics exceed thresholds, enabling rapid response to issues.
