# Day 91: Advanced Security - Security Automation

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Security Automation:** Learn why security automation is important (continuous security, reduce manual work, faster response).
2.  **Explore Security Automation Tools:** Learn about tools: OWASP ZAP, Trivy, Snyk, AWS Security Hub, Azure Security Center.
3.  **Automate Vulnerability Scanning:** Set up automated vulnerability scanning in CI/CD pipelines.
4. **Automate Security Compliance:** Use tools to automatically check security compliance (CIS benchmarks, security policies).
5.  **Create Security Automation:** Build automation that scans, reports, and remediates security issues.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn about security automation, which is essential for maintaining security at scale. Manual security processes don't scale—automation is necessary for continuous security.

Security automation benefits:
- **Continuous security:** Security checks happen automatically
- **Faster response:** Detect and fix issues quickly
- **Consistency:** Same security checks everywhere
- **Scalability:** Handle large numbers of resources
- **Compliance:** Automatically verify compliance

You'll learn about security automation tools:
- **OWASP ZAP:** Web application security testing
- **Trivy:** Container and dependency scanning
- **Snyk:** Dependency and container security
- **AWS Security Hub:** Centralized security findings
- **Azure Security Center:** Azure security management

You'll automate vulnerability scanning:
- Scan containers in CI/CD
- Scan dependencies automatically
- Scan infrastructure for misconfigurations
- Generate security reports

You'll automate compliance:
- Check against CIS benchmarks
- Verify security policies
- Generate compliance reports
- Alert on non-compliance

You'll create security automation:
- Automated scanning workflows
- Security reporting
- Remediation automation (where safe)
- Integration with CI/CD

This knowledge enables you to maintain security at scale.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand security automation and be able to set up automated security scanning and compliance checking. You'll know how to integrate security into CI/CD pipelines and automate security workflows. This knowledge is essential for maintaining security at scale.
