# Day 65: Serverless - Practice Project & Review

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Project Goal:** Build a complete serverless application (e.g., an API, a data processing pipeline, or an event-driven system).
2.  **Create Lambda Functions:** Create multiple Lambda functions for different parts of your application.
3.  **Set Up API Gateway:** Create an API Gateway with routes that trigger your Lambda functions.
4.  **Use Serverless Framework:** Structure your project using the Serverless Framework and deploy it.
5.  **Test and Monitor:** Test your serverless application and monitor it using CloudWatch.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll apply everything you've learned about serverless by building a complete serverless application. This hands-on project will solidify your understanding and give you practical serverless experience.

Build a serverless application, such as:
- **REST API:** CRUD operations for a resource
- **Data processing pipeline:** Process files uploaded to S3
- **Event-driven system:** React to events (database changes, messages)
- **Scheduled tasks:** Run periodic jobs

Create multiple Lambda functions:
- Each function has a specific responsibility
- Functions communicate through events or API calls
- Use environment variables for configuration

Set up API Gateway:
- Define API routes
- Connect to Lambda functions
- Configure authentication if needed
- Set up CORS for web applications

Use Serverless Framework:
- Structure your project properly
- Define everything in `serverless.yml`
- Deploy with one command
- Manage environments (dev, prod)

Test and monitor:
- Test all endpoints
- Monitor function invocations
- Check logs for errors
- Monitor costs and performance

This project will give you real-world experience with serverless architecture.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have built a complete serverless application. You'll have practical experience with Lambda functions, API Gateway, and the Serverless Framework. This project demonstrates your ability to build modern, scalable serverless applications.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Serverless Application:** A complete application built using serverless technologies (Lambda, API Gateway, etc.) with no server management.
*   **Serverless Architecture:** An application architecture that uses serverless services for compute, storage, and other capabilities.
*   **Event-Driven Serverless:** A serverless application that responds to events (file uploads, database changes, messages) rather than HTTP requests.
*   **Serverless API:** An API built entirely with serverless services (API Gateway + Lambda).
*   **Production Serverless:** A serverless application that follows best practices, is well-monitored, and ready for real-world use.
