# Day 20: CI/CD - Practice Project & Review

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Project Goal:** Set up a complete CI/CD pipeline for a project (e.g., a web application, API, or library).
2.  **Create CI Workflow:** Set up a CI workflow that builds and tests your code on every push and pull request.
3.  **Create CD Workflow:** Set up a CD workflow that deploys your application when code is merged to the main branch.
4.  **Use Best Practices:** Follow CI/CD best practices: proper error handling, meaningful workflow names, clear step descriptions.
5.  **Document Your Pipeline:** Document your CI/CD setup, including how it works and how to use it.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll apply everything you've learned about CI/CD by setting up a complete pipeline for a real project. This hands-on project will solidify your understanding and give you practical experience.

Your pipeline should include:
- **CI:** Automatic builds and tests on every push/PR
- **CD:** Automatic deployment when code is merged to main
- **Error Handling:** Proper handling of failures with clear error messages
- **Secrets Management:** Secure storage of sensitive credentials

Follow best practices:
- Use meaningful workflow and job names
- Add clear descriptions to steps
- Handle errors gracefully
- Use matrix builds if testing multiple environments
- Save artifacts when needed

Document your setup thoroughly. Explain how the pipeline works, what triggers it, and how to use it. This documentation will be valuable for team members and future reference.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have set up a complete CI/CD pipeline for a project. You'll have practical experience in creating CI workflows, CD workflows, and following best practices. This project demonstrates your ability to implement CI/CD, a fundamental DevOps skill.
