# Day 32: Container Orchestration - Kubernetes Basics

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Learn kubectl Commands:** Master essential `kubectl` commands: `get`, `describe`, `create`, `apply`, `delete`.
2.  **Create Your First Pod:** Create a simple pod using `kubectl run` or a YAML manifest file.
3.  **Understand Pods:** Learn about pods, their lifecycle, and how containers run inside pods.
4.  **View Pod Logs:** Use `kubectl logs` to view logs from containers in pods.
5.  **Practice Pod Management:** Create, view, describe, and delete pods to understand pod operations.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll dive into Kubernetes basics by working with pods, the fundamental unit in Kubernetes. Understanding pods is crucial—everything in Kubernetes builds on pods.

You'll learn essential `kubectl` commands:
- **`kubectl get`:** List resources (pods, nodes, services)
- **`kubectl describe`:** Get detailed information about a resource
- **`kubectl create`:** Create resources from command line
- **`kubectl apply`:** Apply configuration from YAML files
- **`kubectl delete`:** Delete resources

You'll create your first pod, which is the simplest Kubernetes resource. A pod can contain one or more containers that work together. You'll create pods using both command-line and YAML files.

Understanding pod lifecycle is important:
- **Pending:** Pod is being created
- **Running:** Pod is running
- **Succeeded/Failed:** Pod has completed or failed

You'll also learn to view logs from pods, which is essential for debugging and monitoring.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be comfortable with basic Kubernetes operations. You'll be able to create, manage, and monitor pods using `kubectl`. This knowledge is the foundation for working with more complex Kubernetes resources.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **`kubectl`:** The command-line tool for interacting with Kubernetes clusters.
*   **Pod Lifecycle:** The states a pod goes through: Pending, Running, Succeeded, Failed.
*   **YAML Manifest:** A YAML file that describes Kubernetes resources (pods, services, deployments, etc.).
*   **`kubectl logs`:** Command to view logs from containers in a pod.
*   **Container in Pod:** A pod can contain one or more containers that share the same network and storage.
