# Day 87: Advanced Automation - Advanced Ansible

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Review Ansible Basics:** Review what you learned about Ansible (playbooks, roles, modules).
2.  **Learn Advanced Playbook Features:** Learn advanced features: conditionals, loops, error handling, tags, includes.
3.  **Use Ansible Vault:** Learn to encrypt sensitive data using Ansible Vault (passwords, API keys).
4.  **Create Dynamic Inventories:** Set up dynamic inventories that automatically discover hosts (AWS, Azure, etc.).
5.  **Practice Advanced Scenarios:** Create playbooks for complex scenarios (multi-tier deployments, rolling updates, blue-green deployments).

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn advanced Ansible features that are essential for managing complex infrastructure and applications. These features make Ansible more powerful and flexible.

Advanced playbook features:
- **Conditionals:** Run tasks only when conditions are met (`when` clause)
- **Loops:** Repeat tasks with different values (`loop`, `with_items`)
- **Error handling:** Handle failures gracefully (`ignore_errors`, `failed_when`, `rescue`)
- **Tags:** Run specific parts of playbooks (`tags`)
- **Includes:** Reuse playbook sections (`import_playbook`, `include_tasks`)

Ansible Vault:
- Encrypt sensitive data (passwords, API keys, secrets)
- Store encrypted files in version control safely
- Use vault IDs for different environments
- Encrypt/decrypt files and variables

Dynamic inventories:
- Automatically discover hosts from cloud providers
- No need to manually maintain inventory files
- Use AWS, Azure, GCP inventory plugins
- Filter hosts by tags, regions, etc.

You'll practice advanced scenarios:
- **Multi-tier deployments:** Deploy applications with multiple components
- **Rolling updates:** Update applications without downtime
- **Blue-green deployments:** Switch between environments
- **Conditional deployments:** Deploy based on environment or conditions

This knowledge enables you to handle complex automation scenarios.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand advanced Ansible features and be able to create sophisticated playbooks. You'll know how to use vaults, dynamic inventories, and handle complex deployment scenarios. This knowledge enables you to automate complex infrastructure and application management.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Advanced Ansible:** Using sophisticated Ansible features (conditionals, loops, error handling, dynamic inventories) for complex automation.
*   **Ansible Vault:** A feature for encrypting sensitive data (passwords, secrets) so it can be stored in version control safely.
*   **Dynamic Inventory:** An Ansible inventory that automatically discovers hosts from cloud providers or other sources, rather than static files.
*   **Playbook Tags:** Labels applied to tasks in Ansible playbooks, allowing selective execution of specific tasks.
*   **Conditional Execution:** Running Ansible tasks only when certain conditions are met, using `when` clauses.
*   **Error Handling:** Managing task failures in Ansible using `ignore_errors`, `failed_when`, and `rescue` blocks.
