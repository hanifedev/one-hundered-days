# Day 53: Security - Vulnerability Scanning and Security Testing

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Vulnerability Scanning:** Learn what vulnerability scanning is and why it's important (finding security flaws before production).
2.  **Explore Scanning Tools:** Learn about vulnerability scanning tools: Snyk, OWASP ZAP, Trivy, Clair, AWS Inspector.
3.  **Scan Container Images:** Use a tool to scan Docker images for known vulnerabilities.
4.  **Scan Dependencies:** Scan application dependencies (npm, pip, maven packages) for vulnerabilities.
5.  **Integrate into CI/CD:** Add vulnerability scanning to your CI/CD pipeline to catch issues automatically.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn about vulnerability scanning, which is essential for finding and fixing security issues before they reach production. Vulnerabilities in dependencies, container images, and code can be exploited by attackers.

Vulnerability scanning benefits:
- **Early detection:** Find vulnerabilities during development, not in production
- **Automated:** Integrate into CI/CD for continuous scanning
- **Comprehensive:** Scan code, dependencies, containers, infrastructure
- **Actionable:** Get specific information about vulnerabilities and fixes

You'll learn about scanning different components:
- **Container images:** Scan Docker images for known CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)
- **Dependencies:** Scan application dependencies (libraries, packages) for vulnerabilities
- **Infrastructure:** Scan cloud resources for misconfigurations
- **Code:** Static analysis to find security issues in code

You'll practice using scanning tools and integrate them into CI/CD pipelines. This ensures vulnerabilities are caught automatically and fixed before deployment.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand vulnerability scanning and be able to use scanning tools to find security issues. You'll know how to integrate scanning into CI/CD pipelines for continuous security. This knowledge is essential for maintaining secure systems.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Vulnerability Scanning:** The automated process of identifying security vulnerabilities in applications, dependencies, containers, and infrastructure.
*   **CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures):** A standardized identifier for publicly known security vulnerabilities.
*   **Dependency Scanning:** Scanning application dependencies (libraries, packages) for known vulnerabilities.
*   **Container Scanning:** Scanning container images for known vulnerabilities in base images and installed packages.
*   **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** Analyzing source code to find security vulnerabilities without executing the code.
*   **Security Testing:** The practice of testing applications and infrastructure for security vulnerabilities.
