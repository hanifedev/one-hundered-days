# Day 19: CI/CD - Continuous Deployment Basics

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand CD Concepts:** Learn about Continuous Deployment: automated deployment to staging/production environments.
2.  **Learn Deployment Strategies:** Understand different deployment strategies: direct deployment, blue-green, canary, rolling updates.
3.  **Set Up Deployment Workflow:** Create a GitHub Actions workflow that deploys to a simple environment (e.g., GitHub Pages, a cloud service).
4.  **Use Secrets:** Learn how to use GitHub Secrets to store sensitive information (API keys, passwords) securely.
5.  **Practice Deployment:** Deploy a simple application (e.g., a static website) using your CI/CD pipeline.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn about Continuous Deployment (CD), which automates the process of deploying code to production or staging environments after it passes CI checks.

CD extends CI by:
- Automatically deploying code that passes tests
- Reducing manual deployment errors
- Enabling faster releases
- Ensuring consistent deployments

You'll learn about deployment strategies:
- **Direct Deployment:** Deploy directly to production
- **Blue-Green:** Maintain two identical environments, switch between them
- **Canary:** Deploy to a small subset of users first
- **Rolling Updates:** Gradually update instances

You'll create a deployment workflow that uses GitHub Secrets to store sensitive credentials securely. This is crucial for real-world deployments where you need API keys, passwords, or tokens.

You'll practice by deploying a simple application, giving you hands-on experience with the deployment process.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand Continuous Deployment and be able to create deployment workflows. You'll know how to use secrets securely and understand different deployment strategies. This knowledge enables you to automate deployments, a key DevOps skill.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Continuous Deployment (CD):** The practice of automatically deploying code to production after it passes CI checks.
*   **Deployment Strategy:** A method for deploying applications (e.g., blue-green, canary, rolling updates) to minimize risk and downtime.
*   **GitHub Secrets:** Encrypted variables stored in GitHub that can be used in workflows without exposing sensitive information.
*   **Staging Environment:** A production-like environment used for testing before deploying to production.
*   **Automated Deployment:** The process of deploying applications automatically through CI/CD pipelines, without manual intervention.
