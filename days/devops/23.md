# Day 23: Cloud Computing - S3 Basics

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand S3:** Learn what S3 is and its use cases (object storage, static website hosting, backups, data archiving).
2.  **Create an S3 Bucket:** Create your first S3 bucket using the AWS Console.
3.  **Upload and Download Objects:** Upload files to your S3 bucket and download them.
4.  **Configure Bucket Permissions:** Understand and configure S3 bucket policies and access control.
5.  **Use S3 for Static Website Hosting:** Configure an S3 bucket to host a static website.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn about S3, AWS's object storage service. S3 is incredibly versatile and is used for storing files, hosting static websites, backups, data archiving, and much more.

You'll create an S3 bucket, which is like a folder in the cloud. Buckets have globally unique names and can store unlimited objects (files). You'll:
- Choose a unique bucket name
- Select a region (where data is stored)
- Configure basic settings

You'll upload files to your bucket and download them, understanding the basic object operations. S3 uses a simple key-value model where each object has a unique key (path/name).

Understanding S3 permissions is crucial for security. You'll learn about:
- Bucket policies (JSON documents that define access rules)
- Access Control Lists (ACLs)
- Public vs. private access

Finally, you'll configure S3 to host a static website. This is a common use case—S3 can serve static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files directly, making it perfect for hosting simple websites.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand S3 and be able to create buckets, manage objects, configure permissions, and host static websites. This knowledge is essential for working with cloud storage in DevOps.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **S3 (Simple Storage Service):** AWS's object storage service for storing and retrieving data.
*   **S3 Bucket:** A container for storing objects (files) in S3. Bucket names must be globally unique.
*   **Object:** A file stored in S3, consisting of data and metadata (key, size, last modified date, etc.).
*   **Bucket Policy:** A JSON document that defines access rules for an S3 bucket and its objects.
*   **Static Website Hosting:** Using S3 to serve static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files directly to users.
*   **S3 Key:** The unique identifier (path/name) for an object in an S3 bucket.
