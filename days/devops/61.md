# Day 61: Serverless - Introduction to Serverless Computing

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Serverless:** Learn what serverless computing is and its benefits (no server management, automatic scaling, pay-per-use).
2.  **Explore Serverless Platforms:** Learn about serverless platforms: AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions, Vercel, Netlify.
3.  **Understand Use Cases:** Learn when to use serverless (API backends, event processing, scheduled tasks, microservices).
4.  **Learn Serverless Concepts:** Understand concepts: functions, triggers, events, cold starts, execution limits.
5.  **Explore Serverless Architecture:** Learn about serverless architecture patterns: event-driven, API Gateway + Lambda, serverless microservices.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll be introduced to serverless computing, which is a cloud computing model where you run code without managing servers. Serverless has become increasingly popular for building scalable, cost-effective applications.

Serverless benefits:
- **No server management:** Cloud provider handles infrastructure
- **Automatic scaling:** Scales from zero to thousands of requests automatically
- **Pay-per-use:** Pay only for actual execution time
- **Faster development:** Focus on code, not infrastructure
- **High availability:** Built-in redundancy and failover

Serverless concepts:
- **Functions:** Pieces of code that run in response to events
- **Triggers:** Events that invoke functions (HTTP requests, database changes, scheduled events)
- **Cold starts:** Initial delay when a function hasn't been used recently
- **Execution limits:** Time and memory limits for function execution

You'll learn about serverless architecture patterns and when serverless is appropriate vs. traditional server-based architectures.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand serverless computing and its benefits. You'll be familiar with serverless platforms, concepts, and architecture patterns. This foundation is essential for building modern, scalable applications.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Serverless Computing:** A cloud computing model where you run code without managing servers, with automatic scaling and pay-per-use pricing.
*   **Function as a Service (FaaS):** A serverless computing service that runs functions in response to events.
*   **AWS Lambda:** AWS's serverless compute service that runs code in response to events.
*   **Trigger:** An event that causes a serverless function to execute (HTTP request, database change, scheduled event).
*   **Cold Start:** The initial delay when a serverless function is invoked after being idle, due to container initialization.
*   **Event-Driven Architecture:** An architecture pattern where components communicate through events, well-suited for serverless.
