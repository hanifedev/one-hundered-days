# Day 92: Advanced Security - Zero Trust Architecture

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Zero Trust:** Learn what Zero Trust architecture is and its principles (never trust, always verify, least privilege).
2.  **Explore Zero Trust Components:** Learn about components: identity verification, device validation, network segmentation, continuous monitoring.
3.  **Understand Zero Trust vs Traditional:** Compare Zero Trust with traditional perimeter-based security models.
4.  **Design Zero Trust Architecture:** Design a Zero Trust architecture for a cloud application.
5.  **Implement Zero Trust Principles:** Apply Zero Trust principles to your infrastructure (IAM, network security, monitoring).

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn about Zero Trust architecture, which is a modern security model that assumes no implicit trust. Zero Trust is becoming the standard for cloud security.

Zero Trust principles:
- **Never trust, always verify:** Verify every request, regardless of location
- **Least privilege:** Grant minimum necessary access
- **Assume breach:** Assume attackers are already inside
- **Continuous verification:** Continuously verify identity and device health
- **Micro-segmentation:** Isolate resources with network segmentation

Zero Trust components:
- **Identity verification:** Strong authentication (MFA, SSO)
- **Device validation:** Ensure devices meet security requirements
- **Network segmentation:** Isolate resources, no implicit trust
- **Continuous monitoring:** Monitor all activity for anomalies
- **Encryption:** Encrypt data in transit and at rest

Zero Trust vs Traditional:
- **Traditional:** Trust inside perimeter, verify outside
- **Zero Trust:** Verify everything, trust nothing
- **Traditional:** Network-based security
- **Zero Trust:** Identity and device-based security

You'll design Zero Trust architecture:
- Identity and access management
- Network segmentation
- Monitoring and logging
- Encryption strategy

You'll implement Zero Trust principles:
- Strong IAM policies
- Network segmentation (VPCs, security groups)
- Continuous monitoring
- Least privilege access

This knowledge enables you to build secure, modern architectures.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand Zero Trust architecture and be able to design and implement Zero Trust principles in your infrastructure. You'll know how to build secure architectures that don't rely on network perimeters. This knowledge is essential for modern cloud security.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Zero Trust Architecture:** A security model that assumes no implicit trust and requires verification for every access request, regardless of location.
*   **Never Trust, Always Verify:** The core principle of Zero Trust that requires verifying every request, even from inside the network.
*   **Micro-Segmentation:** Dividing networks into small, isolated segments to limit the impact of security breaches.
*   **Identity-Based Security:** Security that relies on identity verification rather than network location.
*   **Continuous Verification:** The practice of continuously verifying user identity and device health, not just at initial access.
*   **Perimeter-Based Security:** Traditional security model that trusts resources inside a network perimeter, contrasted with Zero Trust.
