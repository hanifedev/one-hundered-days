# Day 47: Configuration Management - Ansible Playbooks

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Playbook Structure:** Learn the structure of Ansible playbooks (hosts, tasks, handlers, variables).
2.  **Write Your First Playbook:** Create a simple playbook that performs basic tasks (e.g., install packages, copy files).
3.  **Use Ansible Modules:** Learn to use common Ansible modules: `apt`, `yum`, `copy`, `template`, `service`, `user`.
4.  **Run Playbooks:** Execute playbooks using `ansible-playbook` command.
5.  **Practice with Tasks:** Create playbooks that configure a server (install software, configure services, set up users).

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn to write Ansible playbooks, which are YAML files that define automation tasks. Playbooks are the core of Ansible—they describe the desired state of your servers.

Playbook structure:
- **Hosts:** Which servers to configure
- **Tasks:** What to do (install packages, copy files, start services)
- **Handlers:** Tasks that run only when notified (e.g., restart service after config change)
- **Variables:** Values that customize playbook behavior

You'll write playbooks using Ansible modules, which are pre-built units that perform specific tasks:
- **`apt`/`yum`:** Install packages
- **`copy`:** Copy files to servers
- **`template`:** Generate files from templates with variables
- **`service`:** Manage services (start, stop, enable)
- **`user`:** Create and manage users

You'll create playbooks that configure servers, such as:
- Installing required software
- Configuring services
- Setting up users and permissions
- Copying configuration files

You'll run playbooks and see Ansible execute tasks, showing what changed on each server.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to write Ansible playbooks and use common modules. You'll understand playbook structure and be able to automate server configuration tasks. This knowledge enables you to manage servers consistently and efficiently.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Playbook:** A YAML file that defines automation tasks and the desired state of servers.
*   **Task:** A single action in a playbook (e.g., install a package, copy a file).
*   **Handler:** A special task that runs only when notified by another task (e.g., restart service after config change).
*   **Ansible Module:** A reusable unit that performs a specific task (install package, manage service, etc.).
*   **`ansible-playbook`:** Command to execute Ansible playbooks.
*   **Idempotency:** The property of Ansible tasks that makes them safe to run multiple times (they only make changes if needed).
