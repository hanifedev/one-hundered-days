# Day 25: Cloud Computing - Practice Project & Review

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Project Goal:** Deploy a simple application to AWS (e.g., a static website on S3, or a simple web app on EC2).
2.  **Set Up IAM:** Create IAM users with appropriate permissions (not using root account).
3.  **Deploy to S3 or EC2:** Deploy your application using either S3 (for static sites) or EC2 (for dynamic apps).
4.  **Configure Security:** Set up security groups, IAM policies, and access controls properly.
5.  **Document Your Setup:** Document your AWS setup, including architecture, security configuration, and how to access the application.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll apply everything you've learned about AWS by deploying a real application. This hands-on project will solidify your understanding and give you practical cloud experience.

Choose a simple application to deploy:
- Static website → Deploy to S3
- Web application → Deploy to EC2
- API service → Deploy to EC2

Set up IAM properly:
- Create IAM users (don't use root account)
- Grant appropriate permissions (principle of least privilege)
- Use IAM roles if needed

Configure security:
- Set up security groups with minimal required access
- Configure S3 bucket policies or EC2 access controls
- Ensure sensitive data is protected

Document your setup thoroughly:
- Architecture diagram (what services you used and how they connect)
- Security configuration
- How to access the application
- Cost considerations (using free tier where possible)

This project will give you real-world experience deploying to the cloud, which is a core DevOps skill.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have deployed an application to AWS. You'll have practical experience with EC2 or S3, IAM configuration, and security best practices. This project demonstrates your ability to work with cloud infrastructure, a fundamental DevOps skill.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Cloud Deployment:** The process of deploying applications to cloud infrastructure (like AWS) instead of on-premises servers.
*   **AWS Architecture:** The design and structure of AWS resources (EC2, S3, etc.) used to host an application.
*   **Cloud Security:** Practices for securing applications and data in the cloud, including IAM, security groups, and encryption.
*   **Infrastructure Documentation:** Clear documentation of cloud infrastructure setup, architecture, and configuration.
*   **Production-Ready Cloud Setup:** A cloud deployment that follows best practices for security, scalability, and maintainability.
