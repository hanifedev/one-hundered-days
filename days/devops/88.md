# Day 88: Advanced Automation - Advanced Shell Scripting

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Review Shell Scripting Basics:** Review what you learned about shell scripting (variables, conditionals, loops).
2.  **Learn Advanced Scripting:** Learn advanced features: functions, arrays, error handling, signal handling, here documents.
3.  **Write Robust Scripts:** Write scripts with proper error handling, logging, and user feedback.
4.  **Use Advanced Commands:** Learn to use advanced commands: `awk`, `sed`, `jq` (JSON processing), `curl` for APIs.
5.  **Practice Complex Scripts:** Create scripts for complex automation tasks (deployment scripts, backup scripts, monitoring scripts).

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn advanced shell scripting techniques that are essential for creating robust, production-ready automation scripts. While tools like Ansible and Terraform are powerful, shell scripts are still valuable for many tasks.

Advanced scripting features:
- **Functions:** Reusable code blocks
- **Arrays:** Store multiple values
- **Error handling:** `set -e`, `set -u`, `trap` for cleanup
- **Signal handling:** Handle interrupts gracefully
- **Here documents:** Multi-line input/output
- **Process substitution:** Advanced I/O redirection

You'll write robust scripts:
- **Error handling:** Exit on errors, handle failures gracefully
- **Logging:** Log operations and errors
- **User feedback:** Provide clear messages
- **Input validation:** Validate user input and parameters
- **Documentation:** Add comments and usage information

You'll use advanced commands:
- **awk:** Text processing and data extraction
- **sed:** Stream editor for text manipulation
- **jq:** JSON processor for API responses
- **curl:** Make HTTP requests, interact with APIs
- **xargs:** Execute commands with arguments from input

You'll practice complex scripts:
- **Deployment scripts:** Automated application deployment
- **Backup scripts:** Automated backup procedures
- **Monitoring scripts:** Health checks and alerting
- **Maintenance scripts:** Automated maintenance tasks

This knowledge enables you to create powerful automation scripts.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand advanced shell scripting and be able to write robust, production-ready scripts. You'll know how to handle errors, process data, and create complex automation. This knowledge enables you to create custom automation solutions.
