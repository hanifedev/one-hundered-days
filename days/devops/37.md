# Day 37: Monitoring & Logging - Prometheus Basics

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Prometheus:** Learn what Prometheus is and why it's popular (open-source, pull-based metrics, powerful query language).
2.  **Install Prometheus:** Install and run Prometheus locally or in a container.
3.  **Explore Prometheus UI:** Access the Prometheus web UI and explore the interface.
4.  **Understand Metrics:** Learn about Prometheus metrics types: Counter, Gauge, Histogram, Summary.
5.  **Write PromQL Queries:** Learn basic PromQL (Prometheus Query Language) to query metrics.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn about Prometheus, which is one of the most popular open-source monitoring tools. Prometheus is widely used in Kubernetes environments and is the foundation of many monitoring stacks.

Prometheus features:
- **Pull-based model:** Prometheus scrapes metrics from targets
- **Time-series database:** Stores metrics with timestamps
- **Powerful query language (PromQL):** Query and aggregate metrics
- **Alerting:** Built-in alerting capabilities

You'll install Prometheus and explore its web UI. The UI allows you to:
- View available metrics
- Write PromQL queries
- Visualize metrics
- Set up alerts

You'll learn about Prometheus metric types:
- **Counter:** Monotonically increasing values (total requests, errors)
- **Gauge:** Values that can go up or down (CPU usage, memory)
- **Histogram:** Distributions of values (request duration)
- **Summary:** Similar to histogram but with quantiles

You'll write basic PromQL queries to retrieve and aggregate metrics. PromQL is powerful and essential for extracting insights from metrics.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand Prometheus and be able to install it, explore metrics, and write basic PromQL queries. This knowledge is the foundation for building monitoring solutions with Prometheus.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Prometheus:** An open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit that collects and stores metrics as time-series data.
*   **Metrics Scraping:** The process of Prometheus pulling metrics from targets at regular intervals.
*   **PromQL (Prometheus Query Language):** A query language for selecting and aggregating time-series data in Prometheus.
*   **Time-Series Database:** A database optimized for storing and querying data points indexed by time.
*   **Counter:** A Prometheus metric type that represents a monotonically increasing value.
*   **Gauge:** A Prometheus metric type that represents a value that can increase or decrease.
*   **Histogram:** A Prometheus metric type that samples observations and counts them in configurable buckets.
