# Day 35: Container Orchestration - Practice Project & Review

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Project Goal:** Deploy a complete application to Kubernetes (e.g., a web application with a database).
2.  **Create Deployments:** Create Deployments for your application components (web server, database, etc.).
3.  **Create Services:** Create Services to expose your deployments and enable communication between components.
4.  **Use ConfigMaps/Secrets:** Use ConfigMaps for configuration and Secrets for sensitive data.
5.  **Scale and Test:** Scale your application, test rolling updates, and verify everything works correctly.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll apply everything you've learned about Kubernetes by deploying a complete application. This hands-on project will solidify your understanding and give you practical Kubernetes experience.

Deploy a multi-component application, such as:
- A web application with a database
- An API with a cache
- A microservices application

Create Deployments for each component:
- Define desired replica count
- Configure resource limits
- Set up health checks

Create Services to:
- Expose your web application
- Enable database access from the application
- Provide stable networking

Use ConfigMaps for:
- Application configuration
- Environment-specific settings

Use Secrets for:
- Database passwords
- API keys
- Certificates

Test scaling, rolling updates, and verify that your application works correctly. This project will give you real-world experience with Kubernetes.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have deployed a complete application to Kubernetes. You'll have practical experience with Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, and Secrets. This project demonstrates your ability to manage containerized applications in Kubernetes, a fundamental DevOps skill.
