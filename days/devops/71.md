# Day 71: Advanced Kubernetes - Ingress and Networking

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Ingress:** Learn what Ingress is and why it's needed (exposing HTTP/HTTPS services, SSL termination, path-based routing).
2.  **Explore Ingress Controllers:** Learn about Ingress controllers: NGINX Ingress, Traefik, AWS ALB Ingress Controller.
3.  **Create an Ingress Resource:** Create an Ingress resource to expose services with path-based or host-based routing.
4.  **Configure SSL/TLS:** Set up SSL/TLS certificates for your Ingress (using cert-manager or manual certificates).
5.  **Test Ingress:** Deploy an application and access it through Ingress, verifying routing and SSL work correctly.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn about Kubernetes Ingress, which is essential for exposing HTTP/HTTPS services to the internet. While Services provide internal networking, Ingress provides external access with advanced routing.

Ingress benefits:
- **External access:** Expose services to the internet
- **SSL/TLS termination:** Handle HTTPS at the Ingress level
- **Path-based routing:** Route different paths to different services
- **Host-based routing:** Route different domains to different services
- **Load balancing:** Built-in load balancing

You'll learn about Ingress controllers, which are required for Ingress to work:
- **NGINX Ingress:** Most popular, feature-rich
- **Traefik:** Modern, automatic configuration
- **Cloud-specific:** AWS ALB, GCP Load Balancer

You'll create Ingress resources that define:
- Host names or IPs
- Path rules
- Backend services
- TLS configuration

You'll set up SSL/TLS using cert-manager for automatic certificate management, or manually configure certificates. Understanding Ingress is crucial for exposing Kubernetes applications.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand Kubernetes Ingress and be able to expose HTTP/HTTPS services with advanced routing and SSL/TLS. You'll know how to configure Ingress controllers and manage external access to your applications. This knowledge is essential for production Kubernetes deployments.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Ingress:** A Kubernetes resource that provides HTTP/HTTPS routing to services, enabling external access with advanced routing rules.
*   **Ingress Controller:** A component that implements Ingress functionality, typically a load balancer or reverse proxy (NGINX, Traefik).
*   **SSL/TLS Termination:** The process of decrypting HTTPS traffic at the Ingress level before forwarding to services.
*   **Path-Based Routing:** Routing requests to different services based on the URL path (e.g., /api → API service, /web → web service).
*   **Host-Based Routing:** Routing requests to different services based on the hostname/domain (e.g., api.example.com, web.example.com).
*   **cert-manager:** A Kubernetes add-on that automatically manages SSL/TLS certificates.
