# Day 81: Advanced Monitoring - Distributed Tracing

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Distributed Tracing:** Learn what distributed tracing is and why it's needed (tracking requests across microservices, identifying bottlenecks).
2.  **Explore Tracing Concepts:** Understand spans, traces, and trace context propagation.
3.  **Learn Tracing Tools:** Learn about distributed tracing tools: Jaeger, Zipkin, AWS X-Ray, Datadog APM.
4.  **Set Up a Tracing Tool:** Install and configure a tracing tool (e.g., Jaeger) in your environment.
5.  **Instrument an Application:** Add tracing instrumentation to a simple application to generate traces.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn about distributed tracing, which is the third pillar of observability (along with metrics and logs). Tracing is essential for understanding how requests flow through distributed systems.

Distributed tracing benefits:
- **Request visibility:** See how requests flow through microservices
- **Bottleneck identification:** Find slow services or operations
- **Dependency mapping:** Understand service dependencies
- **Debugging:** Trace errors across services
- **Performance analysis:** Understand latency at each step

Tracing concepts:
- **Span:** A single operation in a trace (e.g., database query, API call)
- **Trace:** A collection of spans representing a request's journey
- **Trace context:** Information passed between services to connect spans
- **Sampling:** Collecting a subset of traces to manage overhead

You'll learn about tracing tools:
- **Jaeger:** Open-source, CNCF project
- **Zipkin:** Open-source, simple
- **AWS X-Ray:** AWS-native tracing
- **Datadog APM:** Commercial, full-featured

You'll set up a tracing tool and instrument an application to generate traces. This hands-on experience will help you understand how tracing works.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand distributed tracing and be able to set up tracing tools and instrument applications. You'll know how to track requests across distributed systems and identify performance issues. This knowledge is essential for observability in microservices architectures.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Distributed Tracing:** A method of tracking requests as they flow through distributed systems, showing the path and timing of each operation.
*   **Span:** A single operation within a trace, representing work done by a service (e.g., database query, HTTP request).
*   **Trace:** A collection of spans that represent the complete path of a request through a distributed system.
*   **Trace Context:** Information (trace ID, span ID) passed between services to connect spans into a complete trace.
*   **Instrumentation:** Adding code to applications to generate tracing data (spans).
*   **Sampling:** Collecting only a subset of traces to manage performance overhead and storage costs.
