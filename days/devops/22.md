# Day 22: Cloud Computing - EC2 Basics

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand EC2:** Learn what EC2 is and when to use it (virtual servers, scalable compute capacity).
2.  **Launch an EC2 Instance:** Launch your first EC2 instance using the AWS Console (choose a free tier eligible instance).
3.  **Configure Security Groups:** Set up security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic to your instance.
4.  **Connect to EC2 Instance:** Use SSH to connect to your EC2 instance from your local machine.
5.  **Basic Instance Management:** Learn to start, stop, and terminate EC2 instances.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn about EC2, which is AWS's virtual server service. EC2 is one of the most fundamental AWS services and is used extensively in DevOps for hosting applications, running workloads, and building infrastructure.

You'll launch your first EC2 instance:
- Choose an appropriate instance type (start with t2.micro for free tier)
- Select an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) - choose a Linux distribution
- Configure security groups (firewall rules)
- Create or use an existing key pair for SSH access

Security groups are crucial—they act as virtual firewalls controlling traffic to your instances. You'll configure rules to allow SSH access (port 22) from your IP.

You'll connect to your instance using SSH, which allows you to manage the server remotely. This is how you'll interact with cloud servers in real DevOps work.

You'll also learn basic instance management: starting, stopping, and terminating instances. Understanding the lifecycle helps you manage costs and resources effectively.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to launch and manage EC2 instances. You'll understand security groups, SSH access, and basic instance operations. This knowledge is fundamental for working with cloud infrastructure.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **EC2 Instance:** A virtual server in AWS's cloud that you can launch, configure, and manage.
*   **Instance Type:** The hardware configuration of an EC2 instance (CPU, memory, storage, network performance).
*   **AMI (Amazon Machine Image):** A template that contains the software configuration (OS, applications) for an EC2 instance.
*   **Security Group:** A virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic for EC2 instances.
*   **Key Pair:** A set of security credentials (public and private keys) used to securely connect to EC2 instances via SSH.
*   **SSH (Secure Shell):** A protocol for securely accessing remote servers over a network.
