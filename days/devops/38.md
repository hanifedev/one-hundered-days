# Day 38: Monitoring & Logging - Grafana Dashboards

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Grafana:** Learn what Grafana is and how it works with Prometheus (visualization, dashboards, alerting).
2.  **Install Grafana:** Install and run Grafana locally or in a container.
3.  **Connect to Prometheus:** Configure Grafana to use Prometheus as a data source.
4.  **Create Your First Dashboard:** Create a simple dashboard with a few panels showing metrics.
5.  **Explore Dashboard Features:** Learn about different visualization types (graphs, gauges, tables) and dashboard organization.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn about Grafana, which is the visualization layer for Prometheus (and other data sources). While Prometheus stores and queries metrics, Grafana creates beautiful dashboards and visualizations.

Grafana features:
- **Rich visualizations:** Graphs, gauges, heatmaps, tables, and more
- **Dashboard organization:** Organize panels into dashboards
- **Alerting:** Set up alerts based on metrics
- **Multiple data sources:** Connect to Prometheus, InfluxDB, CloudWatch, and more

You'll install Grafana and connect it to Prometheus. This creates a complete monitoring stack:
- Prometheus collects and stores metrics
- Grafana visualizes metrics in dashboards

You'll create your first dashboard with panels showing different metrics. Dashboards are essential for:
- **Operational visibility:** See system health at a glance
- **Troubleshooting:** Identify issues quickly
- **Performance analysis:** Understand system behavior
- **Reporting:** Share metrics with stakeholders

You'll explore different visualization types and learn how to organize dashboards effectively.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand Grafana and be able to create dashboards for visualizing metrics. You'll know how to connect Grafana to Prometheus and create effective visualizations. This knowledge enables you to build complete monitoring solutions.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Grafana:** An open-source analytics and visualization platform that creates dashboards from various data sources.
*   **Dashboard:** A collection of panels (visualizations) organized together to display related metrics.
*   **Panel:** A single visualization in a Grafana dashboard (graph, gauge, table, etc.).
*   **Data Source:** A connection to a metrics database (Prometheus, InfluxDB, CloudWatch) that Grafana queries for data.
*   **Visualization:** A graphical representation of metrics data (line graph, bar chart, gauge, etc.).
*   **Monitoring Stack:** A combination of tools (Prometheus + Grafana) that provide complete monitoring capabilities.
