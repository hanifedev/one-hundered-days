# Day 27: Infrastructure as Code - Terraform Basics

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Configure AWS Provider:** Set up Terraform to work with AWS (configure provider, set up credentials).
2.  **Create Resources:** Write Terraform configuration to create AWS resources (e.g., an S3 bucket, an EC2 instance).
3.  **Use Terraform Commands:** Learn `terraform init`, `terraform plan`, `terraform apply`, and `terraform destroy`.
4.  **Understand Terraform State:** Learn how Terraform tracks state and why it's important.
5.  **Practice Project:** Create a simple infrastructure (e.g., an S3 bucket) using Terraform.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll dive deeper into Terraform by actually creating AWS resources with it. This hands-on experience will help you understand how Terraform works in practice.

You'll configure the AWS provider, which tells Terraform how to connect to AWS. You'll need AWS credentials (access key and secret key) configured. Terraform can use credentials from environment variables, AWS credentials file, or IAM roles.

You'll write Terraform configuration to create resources. For example, you might create an S3 bucket or an EC2 instance. The configuration is declarative—you describe what you want, and Terraform figures out how to create it.

Terraform commands:
- **`terraform init`:** Initializes Terraform (downloads providers, sets up backend)
- **`terraform plan`:** Shows what changes Terraform will make (preview)
- **`terraform apply`:** Creates or updates infrastructure
- **`terraform destroy`:** Removes infrastructure

You'll practice the full workflow: init → plan → apply → verify. Understanding this workflow is crucial for using Terraform effectively.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to use Terraform to create AWS resources. You'll understand the Terraform workflow (init, plan, apply) and how to manage infrastructure with code. This knowledge enables you to manage infrastructure programmatically, a key DevOps skill.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **`terraform init`:** Command that initializes a Terraform working directory, downloading providers and setting up the backend.
*   **`terraform plan`:** Command that creates an execution plan, showing what Terraform will do before making changes.
*   **`terraform apply`:** Command that applies the Terraform configuration, creating or updating infrastructure.
*   **`terraform destroy`:** Command that removes all infrastructure defined in the Terraform configuration.
*   **Terraform Backend:** Where Terraform stores its state file (local file, S3, etc.).
*   **Execution Plan:** A preview of what Terraform will do, shown before applying changes.
