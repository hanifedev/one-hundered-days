# Day 13: Containerization - Creating Dockerfiles

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Dockerfile:** Learn what a Dockerfile is and its role in building custom images.
2.  **Learn Dockerfile Instructions:** Understand common instructions: `FROM`, `RUN`, `COPY`, `ADD`, `WORKDIR`, `EXPOSE`, `CMD`, `ENTRYPOINT`.
3.  **Create Your First Dockerfile:** Write a simple Dockerfile for a basic application (e.g., a Python Flask app or a Node.js app).
4.  **Build an Image:** Use `docker build` to create an image from your Dockerfile.
5.  **Run Your Custom Container:** Run a container from your newly built image and verify it works.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn to create your own Docker images by writing Dockerfiles. This is a core DevOps skill—most applications need custom images tailored to their specific requirements.

A Dockerfile is a text file with instructions for building an image. Key instructions include:
- **`FROM`:** Base image to start from
- **`RUN`:** Execute commands during image build
- **`COPY`/`ADD`:** Copy files into the image
- **`WORKDIR`:** Set the working directory
- **`EXPOSE`:** Document which ports the container uses
- **`CMD`/`ENTRYPOINT`:** Define what runs when the container starts

You'll create a Dockerfile for a simple application. This hands-on experience will help you understand the build process and how to package applications into containers.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to write Dockerfiles and build custom Docker images. You'll understand the common Dockerfile instructions and how to package applications into containers. This skill is essential for containerizing your own applications.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Dockerfile:** A text file containing instructions for building a Docker image.
*   **`FROM`:** Dockerfile instruction that specifies the base image to build upon.
*   **`RUN`:** Dockerfile instruction that executes commands during the image build process.
*   **`COPY`:** Dockerfile instruction that copies files from the host into the image.
*   **`WORKDIR`:** Dockerfile instruction that sets the working directory for subsequent instructions.
*   **`EXPOSE`:** Dockerfile instruction that documents which ports the container will listen on.
*   **`CMD`:** Dockerfile instruction that specifies the default command to run when the container starts.
*   **`docker build`:** Command to build a Docker image from a Dockerfile.
