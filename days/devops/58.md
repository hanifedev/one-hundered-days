# Day 58: Advanced CI/CD - GitOps Introduction

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand GitOps:** Learn what GitOps is and its principles (Git as source of truth, declarative, automated, observable).
2.  **Explore GitOps Benefits:** Understand benefits: version control for infrastructure, audit trail, rollback capability, consistency.
3.  **Learn GitOps Tools:** Learn about GitOps tools: ArgoCD, Flux, Jenkins X, Terraform Cloud.
4.  **Understand GitOps Workflow:** Learn the GitOps workflow: code changes → Git commit → automated sync → infrastructure update.
5.  **Set Up Basic GitOps:** Set up a simple GitOps workflow using a tool like ArgoCD or Flux.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll be introduced to GitOps, which is a methodology for managing infrastructure and applications using Git as the source of truth. GitOps extends DevOps practices by using Git workflows for operations.

GitOps principles:
- **Git as source of truth:** All infrastructure and application configs in Git
- **Declarative:** Describe desired state, not how to achieve it
- **Automated:** Changes in Git automatically sync to infrastructure
- **Observable:** Monitor and verify that actual state matches desired state

GitOps benefits:
- **Version control:** Full history of infrastructure changes
- **Audit trail:** Know who changed what and when
- **Rollback:** Easy rollback by reverting Git commits
- **Consistency:** Same process for all environments
- **Collaboration:** Use Git workflows (PRs, reviews) for infrastructure

You'll learn about GitOps tools:
- **ArgoCD:** Popular GitOps tool for Kubernetes
- **Flux:** CNCF project for GitOps
- **Jenkins X:** CI/CD platform with GitOps
- **Terraform Cloud:** GitOps for Terraform

You'll set up a basic GitOps workflow to understand how it works in practice.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand GitOps and its principles. You'll be familiar with GitOps tools and be able to set up a basic GitOps workflow. This knowledge enables you to implement modern, Git-based operations workflows.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **GitOps:** A methodology for managing infrastructure and applications using Git as the source of truth and automated synchronization.
*   **Source of Truth:** The authoritative source for system configuration. In GitOps, Git is the source of truth.
*   **Declarative Configuration:** Describing the desired state of a system, rather than the steps to achieve it.
*   **Automated Sync:** The automatic process of synchronizing infrastructure with configuration stored in Git.
*   **ArgoCD:** A popular GitOps tool for Kubernetes that automatically syncs applications based on Git repositories.
*   **Flux:** A CNCF project that provides GitOps capabilities for Kubernetes.
