# Day 49: Configuration Management - Ansible with Cloud Resources

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Cloud Modules:** Learn about Ansible modules for cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP).
2.  **Use AWS Modules:** Learn to use Ansible modules for AWS: `ec2_instance`, `ec2_ami`, `s3_bucket`, `rds_instance`.
3.  **Create Cloud Resources:** Write playbooks that create AWS resources (EC2 instances, S3 buckets) using Ansible.
4.  **Combine Infrastructure and Configuration:** Use Ansible to both provision infrastructure and configure it.
5.  **Practice Project:** Create a playbook that provisions EC2 instances and configures them with your application.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn to use Ansible with cloud resources, combining infrastructure provisioning with configuration management. This is powerful—you can use Ansible to both create cloud resources and configure them.

Ansible has modules for cloud providers:
- **AWS:** `ec2_instance`, `s3_bucket`, `rds_instance`, `vpc`, etc.
- **Azure:** `azure_rm_virtualmachine`, `azure_rm_storageaccount`, etc.
- **GCP:** `gcp_compute_instance`, `gcp_storage_bucket`, etc.

You'll use AWS modules to:
- Create EC2 instances
- Create S3 buckets
- Configure security groups
- Set up networking

The power of Ansible is combining infrastructure and configuration:
- Provision EC2 instances
- Configure the instances (install software, deploy applications)
- All in the same playbook

You'll create a playbook that:
- Launches EC2 instances
- Configures them (installs dependencies, deploys application)
- Sets up monitoring or other services

This gives you a complete automation solution that handles both infrastructure and application deployment.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to use Ansible to provision and configure cloud resources. You'll understand how to combine infrastructure provisioning with configuration management, creating complete automation solutions. This knowledge enables you to automate entire application deployments.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Cloud Modules:** Ansible modules that interact with cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) to provision and manage resources.
*   **Infrastructure Provisioning:** The process of creating cloud resources (servers, databases, storage) using automation tools.
*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Managing infrastructure through code (Terraform, Ansible, CloudFormation) rather than manual processes.
*   **Complete Automation:** Using a single tool (Ansible) to both provision infrastructure and configure applications.
*   **Cloud Resource Management:** Using automation tools to create, configure, and manage cloud resources programmatically.
