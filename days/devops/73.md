# Day 73: Advanced Kubernetes - StatefulSets and Persistent Storage

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand StatefulSets:** Learn what StatefulSets are and when to use them (stateful applications, ordered deployment, stable network identity).
2.  **Compare with Deployments:** Understand the differences between Deployments and StatefulSets.
3.  **Learn Persistent Volumes:** Understand PersistentVolumes (PV) and PersistentVolumeClaims (PVC) for persistent storage.
4.  **Create a StatefulSet:** Create a StatefulSet for a stateful application (e.g., a database).
5.  **Configure Persistent Storage:** Set up persistent storage for your StatefulSet using PVCs.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn about StatefulSets and persistent storage, which are essential for running stateful applications (databases, message queues) in Kubernetes.

StatefulSets vs Deployments:
- **StatefulSets:** For stateful applications that need stable identities, ordered deployment, and persistent storage
- **Deployments:** For stateless applications that can be replaced randomly

StatefulSet features:
- **Stable network identity:** Each pod has a stable hostname
- **Ordered deployment:** Pods are created and deleted in order
- **Persistent storage:** Each pod gets its own persistent volume
- **Stable storage:** Storage persists even if pods are recreated

You'll learn about Kubernetes storage:
- **PersistentVolume (PV):** A storage resource in the cluster
- **PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC):** A request for storage by a pod
- **StorageClass:** Defines different types of storage (SSD, HDD, network storage)

You'll create a StatefulSet:
- Define the StatefulSet manifest
- Configure persistent storage using PVCs
- Understand pod naming (statefulset-0, statefulset-1, etc.)
- Test scaling and pod replacement

Understanding StatefulSets is crucial for running databases and other stateful applications in Kubernetes.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand StatefulSets and persistent storage in Kubernetes. You'll be able to deploy stateful applications with stable identities and persistent storage. This knowledge is essential for running databases and stateful services in Kubernetes.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **StatefulSet:** A Kubernetes workload resource for managing stateful applications with stable identities and persistent storage.
*   **PersistentVolume (PV):** A storage resource in a Kubernetes cluster that can be claimed by pods.
*   **PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC):** A request for storage by a pod, which is bound to a PersistentVolume.
*   **StorageClass:** A Kubernetes resource that defines different types of storage (SSD, HDD, network storage) with provisioning policies.
*   **Stateful Application:** An application that maintains state (data) that must persist across pod restarts (databases, message queues).
*   **Stable Network Identity:** A consistent hostname and network identity for pods in a StatefulSet (e.g., db-0, db-1).
