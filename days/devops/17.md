# Day 17: CI/CD - GitHub Actions Basics

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand GitHub Actions:** Learn what GitHub Actions is and how it integrates with GitHub repositories.
2.  **Explore Workflow Concepts:** Understand workflows, jobs, steps, and actions in GitHub Actions.
3.  **Create Your First Workflow:** Create a `.github/workflows/` directory and write a simple workflow file (YAML).
4.  **Set Up a Basic Workflow:** Create a workflow that runs on push events and executes a simple command (e.g., echo "Hello, CI!").
5.  **View Workflow Results:** Push your workflow to GitHub and view the execution results in the Actions tab.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn GitHub Actions, which is a popular CI/CD platform integrated directly into GitHub. It's free for public repositories and provides powerful automation capabilities.

GitHub Actions uses workflows (YAML files) to define automation. Key concepts:
- **Workflow:** An automated process defined in a YAML file
- **Job:** A set of steps that run on the same runner
- **Step:** An individual task in a job
- **Action:** Reusable units of code that perform specific tasks

You'll create your first workflow file in `.github/workflows/`. This workflow will trigger on push events and run a simple command. This hands-on experience will help you understand the basic structure and workflow of GitHub Actions.

After pushing your workflow, you'll see it execute in the GitHub Actions tab, where you can view logs, see execution time, and understand the results.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand GitHub Actions and be able to create basic workflows. You'll know how to structure workflow files and trigger them on repository events. This knowledge is the foundation for implementing CI/CD with GitHub Actions.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **GitHub Actions:** A CI/CD platform integrated with GitHub that automates workflows based on repository events.
*   **Workflow:** An automated process defined in a YAML file, stored in `.github/workflows/`.
*   **Job:** A set of steps that execute on the same runner (virtual machine) in a workflow.
*   **Step:** An individual task within a job that can run commands or use actions.
*   **Action:** Reusable units of code that perform specific tasks, available from the GitHub Actions marketplace.
*   **Runner:** A virtual machine that executes workflows (GitHub-hosted or self-hosted).
