# Day 89: Advanced Automation - Infrastructure Testing

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Infrastructure Testing:** Learn why testing infrastructure is important (catch issues early, ensure correctness, prevent regressions).
2.  **Explore Testing Tools:** Learn about infrastructure testing tools: Terratest, InSpec, Pulumi Testing, AWS Config Rules.
3.  **Write Infrastructure Tests:** Write tests for Terraform configurations (verify resources are created correctly, check configurations).
4.  **Test Ansible Playbooks:** Write tests for Ansible playbooks (verify servers are configured correctly, check service status).
5.  **Practice Testing:** Create a test suite for your infrastructure code to ensure it works correctly.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn about infrastructure testing, which is essential for ensuring your Infrastructure as Code works correctly. Just like application code, infrastructure code should be tested.

Infrastructure testing benefits:
- **Early detection:** Find issues before production
- **Regression prevention:** Ensure changes don't break existing infrastructure
- **Documentation:** Tests document expected behavior
- **Confidence:** Deploy with confidence knowing tests pass
- **Compliance:** Verify infrastructure meets requirements

You'll learn about testing tools:
- **Terratest:** Go-based testing for Terraform
- **InSpec:** Compliance and security testing
- **Pulumi Testing:** Testing for Pulumi (alternative to Terraform)
- **AWS Config Rules:** AWS-native compliance checking

You'll write infrastructure tests:
- **Terraform tests:** Verify resources are created with correct configurations
- **Ansible tests:** Verify servers are configured correctly
- **Integration tests:** Test that components work together
- **Compliance tests:** Verify security and compliance requirements

You'll practice testing:
- Write tests for your Terraform modules
- Test Ansible playbooks
- Run tests in CI/CD pipelines
- Use test frameworks effectively

This knowledge enables you to build reliable, tested infrastructure.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand infrastructure testing and be able to write tests for your Infrastructure as Code. You'll know how to verify infrastructure correctness and prevent regressions. This knowledge enables you to build reliable, tested infrastructure.
