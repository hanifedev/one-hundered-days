# Day 31: Container Orchestration - Introduction to Kubernetes

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Container Orchestration:** Learn what container orchestration is and why it's needed (managing multiple containers, scaling, high availability).
2.  **Explore Orchestration Tools:** Learn about popular orchestration tools: Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, Amazon ECS.
3.  **Understand Kubernetes:** Learn what Kubernetes is and its core concepts (pods, nodes, clusters, control plane).
4.  **Set Up Local Kubernetes:** Install a local Kubernetes environment (Minikube, Docker Desktop with Kubernetes, or kind).
5.  **Verify Installation:** Run `kubectl version` and `kubectl get nodes` to verify Kubernetes is running.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll be introduced to container orchestration, which is essential for managing containerized applications at scale. While Docker handles single containers, orchestration tools manage multiple containers across multiple machines.

Kubernetes (often abbreviated as K8s) is the most popular container orchestration platform. It provides:
- **Automatic scaling:** Scale applications up or down based on demand
- **Self-healing:** Restart failed containers automatically
- **Load balancing:** Distribute traffic across containers
- **Rolling updates:** Update applications without downtime

You'll learn Kubernetes core concepts:
- **Pods:** The smallest deployable unit (one or more containers)
- **Nodes:** Worker machines that run pods
- **Cluster:** A set of nodes managed together
- **Control Plane:** Manages the cluster

You'll set up a local Kubernetes environment to practice. Minikube, Docker Desktop, or kind are good options for local development.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand container orchestration and Kubernetes basics. You'll have a local Kubernetes environment set up and be ready to start working with Kubernetes. This foundation is essential for managing containerized applications at scale.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Container Orchestration:** The automated management of containerized applications, including deployment, scaling, and networking.
*   **Kubernetes (K8s):** An open-source container orchestration platform for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
*   **Pod:** The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, containing one or more containers that share storage and network resources.
*   **Node:** A worker machine in Kubernetes that runs pods. Can be a physical or virtual machine.
*   **Cluster:** A set of nodes (machines) that work together to run containerized applications.
*   **Control Plane:** The set of components that manage the Kubernetes cluster (API server, etcd, scheduler, controller manager).
*   **`kubectl`:** The command-line tool for interacting with Kubernetes clusters.
