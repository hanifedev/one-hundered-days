# Day 34: Container Orchestration - ConfigMaps and Secrets

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand ConfigMaps:** Learn what ConfigMaps are and when to use them (storing configuration data separate from application code).
2.  **Create ConfigMaps:** Create ConfigMaps from literal values, files, or YAML.
3.  **Use ConfigMaps in Pods:** Mount ConfigMaps as environment variables or files in pods.
4.  **Understand Secrets:** Learn what Secrets are and how they differ from ConfigMaps (for sensitive data).
5.  **Create and Use Secrets:** Create Secrets and use them in pods for sensitive information (passwords, API keys).

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn about ConfigMaps and Secrets, which are essential for managing configuration and sensitive data in Kubernetes.

**ConfigMaps** store non-sensitive configuration data:
- Application settings
- Configuration files
- Environment-specific values

They allow you to separate configuration from application code, making applications more flexible and easier to manage across different environments.

**Secrets** store sensitive data:
- Passwords
- API keys
- TLS certificates
- Database credentials

Secrets are similar to ConfigMaps but are designed for sensitive data. While they're not encrypted by default (base64 encoded), they're treated specially by Kubernetes.

You'll learn to:
- Create ConfigMaps and Secrets
- Mount them as environment variables in pods
- Mount them as files in pods
- Update them and see changes reflected in pods

This knowledge is crucial for managing configuration in production Kubernetes deployments.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand ConfigMaps and Secrets in Kubernetes. You'll be able to manage configuration and sensitive data separately from application code, making your deployments more flexible and secure. This knowledge is essential for production Kubernetes applications.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **ConfigMap:** A Kubernetes resource that stores non-sensitive configuration data as key-value pairs.
*   **Secret:** A Kubernetes resource that stores sensitive data (passwords, API keys, certificates) in an encoded format.
*   **Configuration Management:** The practice of managing application configuration separately from code, allowing flexibility across environments.
*   **Environment Variables:** Variables that can be injected into pods from ConfigMaps or Secrets.
*   **Volume Mount:** Attaching ConfigMaps or Secrets as files in pods, allowing applications to read configuration files.
