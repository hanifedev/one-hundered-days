# Day 29: Infrastructure as Code - Terraform Modules

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Modules:** Learn what Terraform modules are and why they're useful (reusability, organization, abstraction).
2.  **Create a Module:** Create a simple Terraform module (a directory with Terraform files that can be reused).
3.  **Use a Module:** Use your module in a Terraform configuration.
4.  **Explore Module Structure:** Understand module structure: inputs (variables), outputs, and resources.
5.  **Practice with Modules:** Create a module for a common resource (e.g., an EC2 instance with security group) and use it.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn about Terraform modules, which are reusable packages of Terraform configurations. Modules help you:
- **Organize code:** Group related resources together
- **Reuse code:** Use the same infrastructure pattern multiple times
- **Abstract complexity:** Hide implementation details behind a simple interface
- **Share code:** Use modules from the Terraform Registry or create your own

A module is simply a directory containing Terraform files. Modules have:
- **Inputs:** Variables that customize the module
- **Outputs:** Values the module exposes
- **Resources:** The actual infrastructure the module creates

You'll create a simple module, perhaps for a common pattern like "EC2 instance with security group" or "S3 bucket with specific configuration." Then you'll use that module in your main configuration.

Modules can be:
- **Local:** In your project directory
- **Remote:** From Git repositories, Terraform Registry, or other sources

Understanding modules is crucial for managing complex infrastructure and following DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand Terraform modules and be able to create and use them. You'll know how to organize code into reusable modules and abstract complexity. This knowledge enables you to write maintainable, scalable Infrastructure as Code.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Terraform Module:** A reusable package of Terraform configurations that can be used multiple times.
*   **Module Input:** A variable passed to a module to customize its behavior.
*   **Module Output:** A value exported from a module that can be used by the calling configuration.
*   **Terraform Registry:** A public repository of Terraform modules that can be reused.
*   **Module Structure:** The organization of a module (variables for inputs, resources for infrastructure, outputs for exported values).
*   **Code Reusability:** The practice of writing code once and using it multiple times, reducing duplication.
