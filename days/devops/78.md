# Day 78: Multi-Cloud - Google Cloud Platform Fundamentals

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Set Up GCP Account:** Create a free GCP account and understand the GCP Free Tier.
2.  **Navigate GCP Console:** Explore the Google Cloud Console and understand its interface.
3.  **Understand Core GCP Services:** Learn about fundamental GCP services: Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, Cloud Functions, Projects.
4.  **Create GCP Resources:** Create basic GCP resources (a Compute Engine instance or Cloud Storage bucket) using the GCP Console.
5.  **Compare Cloud Providers:** Compare GCP, AWS, and Azure to understand their strengths and differences.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn about Google Cloud Platform (GCP), the third major cloud provider. GCP is known for its strengths in data analytics, machine learning, and Kubernetes (Google created Kubernetes).

GCP core concepts:
- **Projects:** Top-level containers for organizing resources
- **Compute Engine:** Virtual machines (equivalent to EC2)
- **Cloud Storage:** Object storage (equivalent to S3)
- **Cloud Functions:** Serverless compute (equivalent to Lambda)
- **GKE:** Google Kubernetes Engine (managed Kubernetes)

You'll explore the GCP Console, which has a different interface than AWS and Azure. Understanding multiple interfaces makes you adaptable.

You'll create basic resources:
- Create a Project
- Create a Compute Engine instance or Cloud Storage bucket
- Understand GCP's resource model

You'll compare all three major cloud providers:
- **AWS:** Largest, most services, enterprise-focused
- **Azure:** Strong Microsoft integration, hybrid cloud
- **GCP:** Strong in data/ML, Kubernetes expertise, developer-friendly

Understanding all three makes you truly cloud-agnostic and valuable.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have a GCP account and be familiar with GCP fundamentals. You'll understand core GCP services and how they compare to AWS and Azure. This knowledge makes you a well-rounded cloud professional.
