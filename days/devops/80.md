# Day 80: Multi-Cloud - Practice Project & Review

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Project Goal:** Design and implement a multi-cloud architecture (e.g., primary on AWS, backup/disaster recovery on Azure).
2.  **Plan Architecture:** Design a multi-cloud architecture with clear use cases for each cloud provider.
3.  **Implement with Terraform:** Use Terraform to provision resources in multiple clouds.
4.  **Test Cross-Cloud Integration:** Verify that resources in different clouds can work together (if applicable).
5.  **Document Multi-Cloud Setup:** Document your multi-cloud architecture, including rationale, costs, and management approach.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll apply everything you've learned about multi-cloud by designing and implementing a multi-cloud architecture. This hands-on project will solidify your understanding and give you practical multi-cloud experience.

Design a multi-cloud architecture:
- **Primary cloud:** Main application infrastructure (e.g., AWS)
- **Secondary cloud:** Backup, disaster recovery, or specific services (e.g., Azure)
- **Use cases:** Clear reasons for using each cloud
- **Integration:** How resources in different clouds work together

Implement with Terraform:
- Use multiple providers in Terraform
- Create resources in both clouds
- Manage everything with Infrastructure as Code
- Use provider aliases if needed

Test integration:
- Verify cross-cloud connectivity (if applicable)
- Test disaster recovery scenarios
- Verify data replication (if applicable)

Document your setup:
- Architecture diagram
- Rationale for multi-cloud approach
- Cost considerations
- Management procedures
- Disaster recovery procedures

This project will give you real-world experience with multi-cloud architectures.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have designed and implemented a multi-cloud architecture. You'll have practical experience with multi-cloud design, Terraform multi-provider usage, and multi-cloud management. This project demonstrates your ability to work with multiple cloud platforms, a valuable DevOps skill.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers
