# Day 18: CI/CD - Building and Testing in CI

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Set Up Build Workflow:** Create a GitHub Actions workflow that builds your application (e.g., compile code, install dependencies).
2.  **Add Test Step:** Add a step to your workflow that runs automated tests.
3.  **Use Matrix Builds:** Learn about matrix builds to test across multiple environments (e.g., different Node.js versions, Python versions).
4.  **Handle Build Artifacts:** Learn how to save build artifacts (compiled files, test reports) from your workflow.
5.  **Practice Project:** Create a CI workflow for a simple project that builds and tests on every push.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn to create practical CI workflows that actually build and test code. This is the core functionality of CI—automatically verifying that code changes don't break the build or tests.

You'll create a workflow that:
- Checks out your code
- Sets up the necessary environment (language runtime, dependencies)
- Builds your application
- Runs tests
- Reports results

Matrix builds allow you to test across multiple configurations simultaneously. For example, you might test your application with Node.js versions 16, 18, and 20 to ensure compatibility.

You'll also learn to save build artifacts—files generated during the build process that you might need later (for deployment, inspection, or debugging).

This hands-on practice will give you experience creating real CI workflows that catch issues before they reach production.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to create CI workflows that build and test applications automatically. You'll understand matrix builds, artifact handling, and how to structure workflows for real projects. This knowledge enables you to implement CI for your own projects.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Build Step:** A step in a CI workflow that compiles code or prepares the application for deployment.
*   **Test Step:** A step in a CI workflow that runs automated tests to verify code quality.
*   **Matrix Build:** Running the same workflow across multiple configurations (versions, operating systems) simultaneously.
*   **Build Artifact:** Files generated during the build process (compiled code, reports) that are saved for later use.
*   **CI Pipeline:** A series of automated steps (build, test, etc.) that run when code changes are committed.
