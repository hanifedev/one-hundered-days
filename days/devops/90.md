# Day 90: Advanced Automation - Practice Project & Review

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Project Goal:** Create a complete automation solution using advanced techniques (Python automation, advanced Ansible, infrastructure testing).
2.  **Write Python Scripts:** Create Python scripts to automate cloud operations and integrate with various tools.
3.  **Create Advanced Ansible Playbooks:** Build sophisticated Ansible playbooks with vaults, dynamic inventories, and error handling.
4.  **Write Infrastructure Tests:** Create a test suite for your infrastructure code.
5.  **Document Your Automation:** Document your automation solution, including how to use it, what it does, and testing procedures.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll apply everything you've learned about advanced automation by creating a complete automation solution. This hands-on project will solidify your understanding and give you practical experience.

Create a complete automation solution:
- **Python scripts:** Automate cloud operations, data processing, API integrations
- **Advanced Ansible:** Complex playbooks with vaults, dynamic inventories, error handling
- **Infrastructure testing:** Test suite for your infrastructure code
- **Integration:** All components work together

Write Python scripts:
- Interact with cloud APIs
- Process data (logs, metrics, reports)
- Integrate with tools and services
- Handle errors gracefully

Create advanced Ansible playbooks:
- Use vaults for secrets
- Use dynamic inventories
- Handle errors and edge cases
- Support multiple environments

Write infrastructure tests:
- Test Terraform configurations
- Test Ansible playbooks
- Verify compliance and security
- Run tests in CI/CD

Document everything:
- How to use the automation
- What each component does
- Testing procedures
- Troubleshooting guide

This project will give you real-world experience with advanced automation.
