# Day 14: Containerization - Docker Compose

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Docker Compose:** Learn what Docker Compose is and why it's useful (orchestrating multi-container applications).
2.  **Learn YAML Syntax:** Understand basic YAML syntax used in `docker-compose.yml` files.
3.  **Create a docker-compose.yml:** Write a `docker-compose.yml` file for a simple multi-container application (e.g., a web app with a database).
4.  **Use Docker Compose Commands:** Learn `docker-compose up`, `docker-compose down`, `docker-compose ps`, `docker-compose logs`.
5.  **Practice with Services:** Define multiple services in your compose file and understand how they communicate.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn Docker Compose, which simplifies running multi-container applications. While `docker run` works for single containers, real applications often need multiple containers (web server, database, cache, etc.) working together.

Docker Compose uses a YAML file (`docker-compose.yml`) to define:
- **Services:** The containers that make up your application
- **Networks:** How services communicate
- **Volumes:** Persistent data storage
- **Environment Variables:** Configuration for services

You'll create a compose file for a simple multi-container setup (e.g., a web app and database). This will help you understand how to orchestrate containers and manage complex applications.

Docker Compose commands are straightforward:
- `docker-compose up`: Start all services
- `docker-compose down`: Stop and remove all services
- `docker-compose ps`: List running services
- `docker-compose logs`: View logs from services

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand Docker Compose and be able to orchestrate multi-container applications. You'll be able to define services, networks, and volumes in a compose file and manage them with Docker Compose commands. This knowledge is essential for deploying complex applications.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Docker Compose:** A tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications using a YAML file.
*   **`docker-compose.yml`:** A YAML file that defines services, networks, and volumes for a Docker Compose application.
*   **Service:** A container definition in a Docker Compose file, representing one component of the application.
*   **Network:** A Docker network that allows containers to communicate with each other.
*   **Volume:** A mechanism for persisting data generated by containers, separate from the container's lifecycle.
*   **`docker-compose up`:** Command to create and start all services defined in the compose file.
*   **`docker-compose down`:** Command to stop and remove all services, networks, and volumes.
