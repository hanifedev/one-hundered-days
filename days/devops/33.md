# Day 33: Container Orchestration - Deployments and Services

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Deployments:** Learn what Deployments are and why they're important (managing pod replicas, rolling updates, rollbacks).
2.  **Create a Deployment:** Create a Deployment using YAML that manages multiple pod replicas.
3.  **Scale Deployments:** Use `kubectl scale` to scale deployments up or down.
4.  **Understand Services:** Learn what Services are and how they provide stable networking for pods.
5.  **Create a Service:** Create a Service to expose your deployment and access it.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn about Deployments and Services, which are essential for running production applications in Kubernetes.

**Deployments** manage pod replicas and provide:
- **Replica management:** Maintain a desired number of pod replicas
- **Rolling updates:** Update applications without downtime
- **Rollbacks:** Revert to previous versions if needed
- **Self-healing:** Automatically replace failed pods

You'll create a Deployment that manages multiple pod replicas. This is how you run applications in production—not with individual pods, but with Deployments that manage pods.

**Services** provide stable networking for pods:
- Pods are ephemeral (they can be created/destroyed)
- Services provide a stable IP address and DNS name
- Services load balance traffic across pod replicas

You'll create a Service to expose your deployment, making it accessible from within or outside the cluster. This is essential for connecting to your applications.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand Deployments and Services in Kubernetes. You'll be able to create scalable, production-ready applications with stable networking. This knowledge is essential for deploying real applications in Kubernetes.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Deployment:** A Kubernetes resource that manages pod replicas and provides rolling updates and rollbacks.
*   **Replica:** A copy of a pod. Deployments maintain a desired number of replicas.
*   **Rolling Update:** A deployment strategy that updates pods gradually, ensuring zero downtime.
*   **Service:** A Kubernetes resource that provides stable networking and load balancing for pods.
*   **Load Balancing:** Distributing traffic across multiple pod replicas to ensure high availability and performance.
*   **`kubectl scale`:** Command to change the number of replicas in a deployment.
