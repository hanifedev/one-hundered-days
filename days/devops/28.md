# Day 28: Infrastructure as Code - Terraform Variables and Outputs

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Variables:** Learn how to use variables in Terraform to make configurations reusable and flexible.
2.  **Define Variables:** Create variable definitions in your Terraform configuration.
3.  **Use Variables:** Reference variables in your resource definitions.
4.  **Understand Outputs:** Learn how to use outputs to display important information after Terraform applies.
5.  **Practice with Variables:** Refactor a previous Terraform configuration to use variables for values like instance types, region, etc.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll learn about Terraform variables and outputs, which make your configurations more flexible and reusable. Variables allow you to parameterize your infrastructure, while outputs provide important information after deployment.

Variables in Terraform:
- Make configurations reusable (same code, different values)
- Improve maintainability (change values in one place)
- Allow customization without modifying code
- Support different environments (dev, staging, prod)

You'll define variables with types (string, number, bool, list, map) and optionally provide default values. You can pass variable values via:
- Command line (`-var` flag)
- Variable files (`.tfvars`)
- Environment variables
- Default values in variable definitions

Outputs are useful for:
- Displaying important information (IP addresses, resource IDs)
- Passing values to other Terraform configurations
- Providing information to users or other systems

You'll refactor a previous configuration to use variables, making it more flexible and maintainable.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand Terraform variables and outputs. You'll be able to create flexible, reusable configurations and output important information. This knowledge enables you to write maintainable Infrastructure as Code.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Terraform Variable:** A parameter in Terraform that allows you to customize configuration without modifying code.
*   **Variable Definition:** The declaration of a variable in Terraform, including its type, description, and optional default value.
*   **`.tfvars` File:** A file containing variable values, used to pass values to Terraform configurations.
*   **Terraform Output:** A value exported from a Terraform configuration after it's applied, useful for displaying important information.
*   **Parameterized Configuration:** A Terraform configuration that uses variables to make it flexible and reusable.
