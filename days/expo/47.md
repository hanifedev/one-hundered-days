# Day 47: State Management - Building a Context Provider

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Context Provider Pattern:** Learn the common pattern of creating a Context Provider component that manages state and provides it to children.
2.  **Combining useState with Context:** Build a Context Provider that uses `useState` to manage state and provides both the state and setter functions through context.
3.  **Custom Context Hook:** Create a custom hook (e.g., `useAppContext()`) that wraps `useContext()` for easier access and better error handling.
4.  **Multiple Contexts:** Learn when and how to split your application into multiple contexts (e.g., `AuthContext`, `ThemeContext`, `CartContext`).
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Refactor your To-Do app to use Context API for global state management instead of prop drilling.

## 📖 Task Explanations

A Context Provider is typically a component that wraps your app and manages the state you want to share. It uses `useState` or other hooks internally and provides both the state and functions to update it through the context. This pattern keeps your state management logic organized and reusable.

Creating a custom hook for accessing context makes your code cleaner and provides a single place to add error handling (like checking if the context is used outside its provider). Splitting contexts by domain (authentication, theme, shopping cart) keeps your code organized and prevents unnecessary re-renders.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to build robust Context Providers that manage global state effectively. You'll understand how to structure contexts, create custom hooks for easier access, and organize multiple contexts in your application. This knowledge enables you to build scalable state management solutions using React's built-in features.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Context Provider Component:** A component that wraps part of your app and provides context values to all child components.
*   **Custom Hook:** A reusable function that uses React hooks internally, allowing you to extract and share stateful logic.
*   **Context Splitting:** The practice of creating separate contexts for different domains of your application to improve organization and performance.
*   **Provider Pattern:** A design pattern where a component provides data or functionality to its children through context.
*   **State Management Logic:** The code that handles creating, reading, updating, and deleting state.
