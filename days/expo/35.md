# Day 35: User Input & Project - Completing the To-Do App

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Implement Delete Functionality:** Add the ability to delete to-do items (e.g., swipe to delete or a delete button).
2.  **Implement Toggle Complete:** Add functionality to mark items as complete/incomplete (with visual feedback).
3.  **Add Form Validation:** Implement validation to prevent adding empty to-do items.
4.  **Enhance UI/UX:** Improve the visual design, add animations for adding/removing items, and ensure a smooth user experience.
5.  **Optional: Edit Functionality:** If time permits, add the ability to edit existing to-do items.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today you'll complete your To-Do app by adding the remaining essential features. Deleting items and toggling completion status are core features that users expect. Adding form validation ensures data quality, and enhancing the UI/UX makes your app feel polished and professional.

This is your first complete MVP (Minimum Viable Product). By the end of today, you'll have a fully functional application that demonstrates your ability to build real-world React Native apps. Take time to polish the details—small touches like smooth animations and clear visual feedback make a big difference in user experience.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have completed a fully functional To-Do application that demonstrates your mastery of React Native fundamentals: components, state management, user input, list rendering, and styling. This project showcases your ability to build complete, production-ready mobile applications and will be a valuable addition to your portfolio.
