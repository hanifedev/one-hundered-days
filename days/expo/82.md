# Day 82: Animations (II) - Reanimated Gestures and Interactions

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Gesture Handler Integration:** Learn how to use `react-native-gesture-handler` with Reanimated for gesture-driven animations.
2.  **Pan Gesture:** Create drag-and-drop animations using `useAnimatedGestureHandler` and pan gestures.
3.  **Gesture-Driven Animations:** Build animations that respond smoothly to user gestures (swipe, drag, pinch).
4.  **Animated Events:** Use `useAnimatedGestureHandler` to create animations that follow user input.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Build interactive components with gesture-driven animations (draggable cards, swipeable items).

## 📖 Task Explanations

Reanimated works seamlessly with react-native-gesture-handler to create smooth, gesture-driven animations. Unlike Animated API's PanResponder, gesture handler provides better performance and more gesture types. The combination of Reanimated and gesture handler is the modern standard for interactive animations.

Using `useAnimatedGestureHandler` allows you to create animations that respond to gestures while running entirely on the UI thread. This creates buttery-smooth interactions that feel native and responsive.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to create gesture-driven animations using Reanimated and gesture handler. You'll understand how to build interactive animations that respond to user input smoothly. This knowledge enables you to create modern, engaging user interfaces.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Gesture Handler:** A library that provides high-performance gesture recognition for React Native.
*   **Pan Gesture:** A gesture that tracks finger movement across the screen (drag).
*   **`useAnimatedGestureHandler`:** A Reanimated hook that creates gesture handlers that run on the UI thread.
*   **Gesture-Driven Animation:** An animation that responds to and follows user gestures.
*   **Native Gesture:** A gesture that's recognized and handled by the native layer for better performance.
