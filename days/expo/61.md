# Day 61: Architectural Approach - Separation of Concerns

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understanding Separation of Concerns:** Learn what separation of concerns means and why it's important for maintainable code.
2.  **Code Organization:** Understand how to organize your code into logical layers (UI, business logic, data access).
3.  **Folder Structure:** Learn common folder structures for React Native projects (components, screens, services, utils, types).
4.  **Extracting Business Logic:** Practice moving business logic out of components into separate files (utils, services).
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Refactor an existing project to separate concerns, moving logic out of components into appropriate files.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Separation of concerns is a fundamental principle in software development. It means organizing your code so that each part has a single, well-defined responsibility. In React Native, this typically means separating UI components from business logic, data fetching, and utility functions.

A well-organized project structure makes it easier to find code, test it, and maintain it as your app grows. Understanding how to structure your project is crucial for building scalable applications that teams can work on effectively.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand the importance of separation of concerns and how to organize your React Native project effectively. You'll be able to structure your codebase in a way that makes it easier to maintain, test, and scale. This knowledge is essential for professional development and working in team environments.
