# Day 77: Animations (I) - Animation Types and Easing

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Animation Types:** Learn about different animation types: `timing` (duration-based), `spring` (physics-based), and `decay` (momentum-based).
2.  **Timing Animations:** Deep dive into `Animated.timing()` with different durations and easing functions.
3.  **Spring Animations:** Learn how to use `Animated.spring()` for natural, physics-based animations.
4.  **Easing Functions:** Understand different easing functions (linear, ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out) and when to use each.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Create multiple animations using different animation types and easing functions to see how they feel different.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Different animation types create different feelings: timing animations are predictable and controlled, spring animations feel natural and bouncy, and decay animations simulate momentum. Understanding when to use each type helps you create animations that feel right for your use case.

Easing functions control how animations accelerate and decelerate. The right easing function can make an animation feel natural and polished. Linear easing feels robotic, while ease-in-out feels smooth and natural for most UI animations.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand different animation types and easing functions. You'll know when to use timing vs. spring animations and how to choose appropriate easing functions. This knowledge enables you to create animations that feel polished and appropriate for your use case.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Timing Animation:** An animation that changes a value over a fixed duration with an easing function.
*   **Spring Animation:** A physics-based animation that simulates a spring, creating natural, bouncy motion.
*   **Decay Animation:** An animation that simulates momentum, gradually slowing down (like a scroll that comes to rest).
*   **Easing Function:** A function that determines the rate of change of an animation over time.
*   **Animation Duration:** The length of time an animation takes to complete.
