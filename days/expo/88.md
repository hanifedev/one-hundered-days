# Day 88: Expo SDK & Native Access - Push Notifications

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Introduction to Push Notifications:** Understand what push notifications are and why they're important for mobile apps.
2.  **Expo Notifications:** Learn how to use `expo-notifications` to send and receive push notifications.
3.  **Notification Permissions:** Request notification permissions and handle permission states.
4.  **Local Notifications:** Create and schedule local notifications that don't require a server.
5.  **Push Notification Setup:** Understand the setup process for push notifications (Expo Push Notification service, device tokens).

## 📖 Task Explanations

Push notifications are essential for engaging users and keeping them informed. Expo Notifications makes it relatively easy to implement push notifications without writing native code. You can send notifications from your server or schedule local notifications that don't require internet.

Understanding the notification flow (registering device, getting tokens, sending notifications) is important for production apps. Push notifications are a key feature for many app types (messaging, social media, productivity, e-commerce).

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand how to implement push notifications in your Expo applications. You'll be able to request permissions, send local notifications, and understand the setup for push notifications. This knowledge enables you to build apps that can engage users with notifications.
