# Day 41: API Integration (I) - Introduction to HTTP and Fetch API

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understanding HTTP:** Learn the basics of HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), including HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and status codes.
2.  **Introduction to APIs:** Understand what an API (Application Programming Interface) is and how mobile apps communicate with servers.
3.  **Fetch API Basics:** Learn how to use the native `fetch()` function to make HTTP requests in React Native.
4.  **Making Your First GET Request:** Create a simple GET request to fetch data from a public API (e.g., JSONPlaceholder, Dog API).
5.  **Handling Response:** Learn how to parse JSON responses using `.json()` and handle the response data.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today marks the beginning of connecting your React Native app to the outside world. APIs allow your app to fetch data from servers, send data, and interact with backend services. The `fetch()` API is built into JavaScript and React Native, making it the most basic way to make HTTP requests.

Understanding HTTP fundamentals is crucial—you'll use GET to retrieve data, POST to create new resources, and other methods for different operations. Status codes (like 200 for success, 404 for not found) tell you whether your request succeeded. This foundation is essential for all API work.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand how HTTP works and be able to make basic API requests using the `fetch()` function. You'll know how to retrieve data from a server and parse JSON responses. This knowledge is the foundation for building apps that interact with real-world data and services.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):** The protocol used for communication between clients (like your app) and servers.
*   **API (Application Programming Interface):** A set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other.
*   **`fetch()`:** A built-in JavaScript function for making HTTP requests.
*   **GET Request:** An HTTP method used to retrieve data from a server.
*   **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):** A lightweight data format commonly used for API responses.
*   **Status Code:** A numeric code that indicates the result of an HTTP request (e.g., 200 = success, 404 = not found, 500 = server error).
