# Day 81: Animations (II) - Introduction to React Native Reanimated

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Why Reanimated?** Understand the limitations of Animated API and why Reanimated is needed (better performance, worklets, gesture handling).
2.  **Installation:** Install `react-native-reanimated` in your Expo project.
3.  **Core Concepts:** Learn about worklets (functions that run on the UI thread) and shared values.
4.  **Basic Reanimated:** Create your first Reanimated animation using `useSharedValue` and `useAnimatedStyle`.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Convert a simple Animated API animation to Reanimated to see the difference.

## 📖 Task Explanations

React Native Reanimated is a more powerful animation library that runs animations on the UI thread, providing better performance and smoother animations. Unlike Animated API, Reanimated allows you to write animations that run entirely on the native side, keeping the JavaScript thread free.

Worklets are functions that can run on the UI thread, enabling complex animations without blocking JavaScript. Shared values are the Reanimated equivalent of Animated values, but they're more powerful and can be accessed from both JavaScript and the UI thread.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand React Native Reanimated and its advantages over the Animated API. You'll be able to create basic Reanimated animations using shared values and animated styles. This knowledge provides the foundation for building high-performance animations.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **React Native Reanimated:** A high-performance animation library that runs animations on the UI thread.
*   **Worklet:** A function that can run on the UI thread, enabling animations without blocking JavaScript.
*   **Shared Value:** A Reanimated value that can be accessed from both JavaScript and the UI thread.
*   **`useSharedValue`:** A hook that creates a shared value for animations.
*   **`useAnimatedStyle`:** A hook that creates animated styles based on shared values.
*   **UI Thread:** The native thread where UI updates happen, separate from the JavaScript thread.
