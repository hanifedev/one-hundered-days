# Day 31: User Input & Project - TextInput Basics

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Introduction to TextInput:** Learn about the `TextInput` component, the primary way to collect text input from users in React Native.
2.  **Basic TextInput Properties:** Understand essential props like `value`, `onChangeText`, `placeholder`, `keyboardType`, and `secureTextEntry`.
3.  **Controlled Components:** Learn how to make `TextInput` a controlled component by managing its value with `useState`.
4.  **Input Styling:** Apply styling to `TextInput` components to match your app's design.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Create a simple form with multiple `TextInput` fields (e.g., name, email, password).

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today you'll learn how to collect text input from users, which is fundamental for building interactive applications. The `TextInput` component is React Native's equivalent to HTML's `<input>` element, but with mobile-specific features like different keyboard types and secure text entry for passwords.

Understanding controlled components is crucial—by managing the input's value with state, you have full control over the input's behavior and can validate, transform, or respond to changes in real-time. This pattern is essential for form handling in React Native.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to create forms that collect user input using `TextInput` components. You'll understand how to manage input state, style text inputs, and configure them for different use cases (like email, password, or numeric input). This knowledge is essential for building any app that requires user interaction.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **`TextInput`:** A React Native component that allows users to enter text. It's the primary component for collecting text-based user input.
*   **Controlled Component:** A component whose value is controlled by React state, giving you full control over its behavior.
*   **`keyboardType`:** A prop that determines which keyboard type appears on mobile devices (e.g., `email-address`, `numeric`, `phone-pad`).
*   **`secureTextEntry`:** A prop that hides the text input (useful for passwords).
*   **`onChangeText`:** A callback function that is called whenever the text in the input changes.
