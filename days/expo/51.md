# Day 51: State Management - Introduction to Redux

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understanding Redux:** Learn what Redux is and why it's used for state management in large applications.
2.  **Redux Core Concepts:** Understand the three core concepts: Store (single source of truth), Actions (descriptions of what happened), and Reducers (pure functions that update state).
3.  **Redux Flow:** Learn the unidirectional data flow: Action → Reducer → Store → Component.
4.  **Installing Redux:** Install `@reduxjs/toolkit` and `react-redux` packages in your Expo project.
5.  **Setting Up Redux Store:** Create your first Redux store and configure it in your app.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Redux is a popular state management library that provides a predictable way to manage application state. It's especially useful for large applications where state management becomes complex. Redux follows a strict pattern: actions describe what happened, reducers determine how state changes, and the store holds the application state.

Redux Toolkit is the modern, recommended way to use Redux—it simplifies the setup and reduces boilerplate code. Understanding Redux's core concepts is essential, as many large-scale applications use Redux for state management. Even if you don't use Redux in every project, understanding it makes you a more versatile developer.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand Redux's core concepts and architecture. You'll be able to set up a Redux store in your React Native application and understand how the Redux data flow works. This knowledge provides a foundation for using Redux in complex applications and makes you familiar with industry-standard state management patterns.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Redux:** A predictable state container for JavaScript applications, commonly used with React.
*   **Store:** The single source of truth that holds the entire application state in Redux.
*   **Action:** An object that describes what happened in your application (typically has a `type` and optional `payload`).
*   **Reducer:** A pure function that takes the current state and an action, and returns the new state.
*   **Redux Toolkit:** The official, opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development.
*   **Unidirectional Data Flow:** A pattern where data flows in one direction (Action → Reducer → Store → Component), making state changes predictable.
