# Day 46: State Management - Context API Introduction

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understanding Global State:** Learn why you need global state management and the problems it solves (avoiding prop drilling, sharing state across components).
2.  **Introduction to Context API:** Understand what React Context is and how it provides a way to share data across the component tree without prop drilling.
3.  **Creating a Context:** Learn how to create a new Context using `createContext()`.
4.  **Context Provider:** Understand how to wrap your app (or part of it) with a Context Provider to make the context available to child components.
5.  **Consuming Context:** Learn how to use the `useContext()` hook to access context values in components.

## 📖 Task Explanations

As your app grows, you'll find yourself passing props through many component levels just to get data to a deeply nested component. This is called "prop drilling" and it makes your code harder to maintain. Context API provides a solution by allowing you to share state globally without passing props through every level.

Context API is built into React, so you don't need any external libraries. It's perfect for sharing data that many components need (like user authentication, theme settings, or app-wide configuration). Understanding Context API is the foundation for more advanced state management solutions.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand how to use React Context API to share state across your application without prop drilling. You'll be able to create contexts, provide values to components, and consume those values anywhere in your component tree. This knowledge enables you to build more maintainable applications with cleaner component hierarchies.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Global State:** State that needs to be accessed by multiple components throughout your application.
*   **Prop Drilling:** The practice of passing props through multiple component levels, even when intermediate components don't use them.
*   **Context API:** A React feature that allows you to share data across the component tree without prop drilling.
*   **Context Provider:** A component that makes context values available to all its child components.
*   **`useContext()` Hook:** A React hook that allows components to access context values.
*   **Context Consumer:** A component or hook that reads values from a context.
