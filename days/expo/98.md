# Day 98: CI/CD & Final Project - Over-the-Air Updates with EAS Update

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **EAS Update:** Learn what EAS Update is and how it enables over-the-air (OTA) updates for your app.
2.  **Update Channels:** Understand update channels (production, preview) and how to use them.
3.  **Publishing Updates:** Learn how to publish updates to your app without going through app store review.
4.  **Update Strategy:** Understand when to use OTA updates vs. app store updates.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Set up EAS Update and publish an update to your app.

## 📖 Task Explanations

EAS Update allows you to push JavaScript and asset updates to your app without going through app store review. This is powerful for bug fixes, feature updates, and A/B testing. However, there are limitations—you can't update native code or change app permissions via OTA updates.

Understanding update channels helps you manage different versions (production, staging, preview). OTA updates are a key advantage of Expo and React Native, allowing you to fix bugs and add features quickly.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand EAS Update and how to use it for over-the-air updates. You'll know how to publish updates and manage update channels. This knowledge enables you to update your apps quickly without app store review.
