# Day 85: Animations (II) - Practice Project

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Project Goal:** Build a complete feature with advanced animations using Reanimated or Moti.
2.  **Animation Types:** Use multiple animation patterns (gestures, sequences, spring animations).
3.  **Performance:** Ensure animations run smoothly at 60fps using UI thread animations.
4.  **Interactive Elements:** Include gesture-driven animations that respond to user input.
5.  **Polish:** Create polished animations with proper easing, timing, and smooth transitions.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today you'll consolidate all your Reanimated/Moti knowledge by building a feature with comprehensive animations. This project should demonstrate your ability to create high-performance animations, handle gestures, and build smooth, polished user experiences.

Pay attention to performance—all animations should run on the UI thread for maximum smoothness. Good animations enhance the user experience without being distracting. This project showcases your animation skills and will be valuable for your portfolio.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have built a feature with advanced, high-performance animations using Reanimated or Moti. You'll have practical experience with gesture handling, animation sequences, and performance optimization. This project demonstrates your ability to create professional, animated user interfaces.
