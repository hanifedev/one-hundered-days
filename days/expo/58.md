# Day 58: Local Data - SQLite Database in Expo

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Introduction to SQLite:** Understand what SQLite is and when to use it instead of AsyncStorage (complex queries, relationships, large datasets).
2.  **Expo SQLite:** Learn how to use `expo-sqlite` to create and interact with SQLite databases in Expo apps.
3.  **Creating Tables:** Learn how to create database tables with proper schema definitions.
4.  **SQL Queries:** Understand how to write SQL queries for inserting, selecting, updating, and deleting data.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Build a simple app that uses SQLite to store and query structured data (e.g., a notes app, expense tracker, or contact list).

## 📖 Task Explanations

SQLite is a lightweight, embedded database that's perfect for mobile apps when you need to store structured data with relationships and complex queries. While AsyncStorage is great for simple key-value storage, SQLite is better for apps that need to query, filter, and relate data (like a todo app with categories, a notes app with tags, or an expense tracker).

Expo provides `expo-sqlite` which makes it easy to use SQLite in your apps. Understanding SQL basics (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) is essential for working with SQLite. This knowledge is valuable for building data-intensive mobile applications.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand how to use SQLite databases in Expo applications. You'll be able to create tables, write SQL queries, and build apps that store and retrieve structured data efficiently. This knowledge enables you to build more sophisticated applications that require complex data management.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **SQLite:** A lightweight, embedded relational database management system that stores data in a single file.
*   **Database Schema:** The structure of a database, including tables, columns, data types, and relationships.
*   **SQL (Structured Query Language):** A language used to communicate with databases for querying and manipulating data.
*   **Table:** A collection of related data organized in rows and columns in a database.
*   **Query:** A request for data or information from a database.
*   **Embedded Database:** A database that runs in the same process as the application, without requiring a separate server.
