# Day 93: Performance Optimization - Image and Asset Optimization

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Image Optimization:** Learn how to optimize images (compression, sizing, format selection) for mobile apps.
2.  **Image Loading:** Understand how to optimize image loading (lazy loading, caching, placeholder images).
3.  **Asset Optimization:** Learn best practices for optimizing app assets (images, fonts, icons) to reduce bundle size.
4.  **Memory Management:** Understand how images affect memory usage and how to prevent memory leaks.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Optimize images in an existing app, reducing load times and memory usage.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Images are often the largest assets in mobile apps and can significantly impact performance and bundle size. Optimizing images (compression, appropriate sizing, modern formats) reduces load times and memory usage. Understanding image optimization is crucial for building fast apps.

Lazy loading images (loading only when needed) and caching can dramatically improve performance. Memory management is important—loading too many large images can cause crashes. These optimizations are essential for production apps.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand how to optimize images and assets in React Native applications. You'll know techniques for reducing bundle size, improving load times, and managing memory. This knowledge enables you to build apps that load quickly and use resources efficiently.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Image Optimization:** Techniques for reducing image file size while maintaining quality.
*   **Lazy Loading:** Loading images only when they're about to be visible, improving initial load time.
*   **Image Caching:** Storing loaded images in memory or disk to avoid reloading them.
*   **Bundle Size:** The total size of an app's code and assets, affecting download and install time.
*   **Memory Management:** Controlling how much memory an app uses to prevent crashes and slowdowns.
