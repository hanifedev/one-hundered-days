# Day 68: Unit Testing (Jest) - Testing Reducers and State Logic

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Testing Reducers:** Learn how to test Redux reducers (or useReducer reducers) by providing initial state and actions.
2.  **Reducer Test Structure:** Understand how to structure tests for reducers (testing each action type, edge cases).
3.  **State Immutability:** Verify that reducers return new state objects instead of mutating existing ones.
4.  **Testing Complex Reducers:** Learn how to test reducers with nested state, arrays, and complex data structures.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Write comprehensive tests for reducers in your Redux or Context API state management.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Reducers are pure functions that are perfect for unit testing. You provide an initial state and an action, and verify that the returned state is correct. Testing reducers ensures your state management logic works correctly and helps catch bugs before they reach your UI.

Testing state immutability is crucial—reducers must not mutate state. Writing tests that verify immutability helps prevent bugs and ensures your state management follows Redux principles. Testing complex reducers with nested state requires careful test setup but follows the same principles.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to write comprehensive tests for reducers and state management logic. You'll understand how to test state updates, verify immutability, and handle complex state structures. This knowledge ensures your state management is reliable and bug-free.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Reducer Test:** A test that verifies a reducer function correctly updates state based on actions.
*   **State Immutability:** The principle that state should not be mutated directly, but replaced with new objects.
*   **Action Testing:** Testing how different actions affect the state in a reducer.
*   **Initial State:** The starting state before any actions are applied in a reducer test.
*   **State Assertion:** Verifying that the state returned by a reducer matches the expected state.
