# Day 36: Navigation - React Navigation Setup

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Introduction to Navigation:** Understand why navigation is essential in mobile applications and how it differs from web navigation.
2.  **React Navigation Library:** Learn about React Navigation, the most popular navigation library for React Native.
3.  **Installation:** Install React Navigation and its dependencies (`@react-navigation/native`, `@react-navigation/stack`, and required peer dependencies).
4.  **Basic Setup:** Set up the `NavigationContainer` in your app and understand its role as the navigation state manager.
5.  **Create Your First Navigator:** Set up a basic Stack Navigator with two simple screens to understand the navigation structure.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Navigation is fundamental to mobile app development. Unlike web apps where URLs handle navigation, mobile apps use a navigation stack managed by libraries like React Navigation. Today you'll set up React Navigation, which is the industry standard for React Native navigation.

The `NavigationContainer` is the root component that manages the navigation state for your entire app. Understanding this setup is crucial before you can create navigators and navigate between screens. This foundation will enable you to build complex navigation structures in the coming days.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have React Navigation installed and configured in your Expo project. You'll understand the basic structure of navigation in React Native and have created your first navigator. This knowledge is the foundation for building multi-screen applications with proper navigation flow.
