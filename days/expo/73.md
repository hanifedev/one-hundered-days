# Day 73: Component Testing - Testing with Context and Navigation

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Testing with Context:** Learn how to test components that use Context API by providing mock context values.
2.  **Testing with Redux:** Understand how to test components connected to Redux store using test utilities.
3.  **Testing Navigation:** Learn how to test components that use React Navigation (mocking navigation props).
4.  **Test Wrappers:** Create reusable test wrapper components that provide context, Redux store, or navigation to components under test.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Write tests for components that use Context, Redux, or Navigation, ensuring they work correctly with these dependencies.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Many components depend on Context, Redux, or Navigation. Testing these components requires providing these dependencies in your tests. Creating test wrappers (helper components that provide context/store/navigation) makes it easier to test components that depend on these systems.

Understanding how to test components with dependencies is essential because most real-world components use some form of state management or navigation. These tests ensure your components work correctly within the larger application architecture.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to test components that use Context, Redux, or Navigation. You'll know how to provide these dependencies in tests and create reusable test utilities. This knowledge enables you to test real-world components that depend on application-wide systems.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Test Wrapper:** A component or utility that provides dependencies (context, store, navigation) to components in tests.
*   **Mock Context:** A fake context value provided to components during testing.
*   **Mock Store:** A fake Redux store used for testing components connected to Redux.
*   **Mock Navigation:** Fake navigation props or objects used to test components that use React Navigation.
*   **Dependency Injection:** Providing dependencies to components from outside, making them easier to test.
