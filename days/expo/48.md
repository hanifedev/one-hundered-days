# Day 48: State Management - useReducer Hook

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Introduction to useReducer:** Understand when to use `useReducer` instead of `useState` (for complex state logic with multiple sub-values).
2.  **Reducer Function:** Learn how to write a reducer function that takes the current state and an action, and returns the new state.
3.  **Actions and Action Types:** Understand how to structure actions (objects with a `type` and optional `payload`) for predictable state updates.
4.  **Dispatching Actions:** Learn how to use `dispatch` to trigger state updates by sending actions to the reducer.
5.  **Combining useReducer with Context:** Build a Context Provider that uses `useReducer` instead of `useState` for more complex state management.

## 📖 Task Explanations

`useReducer` is like `useState`, but for more complex state logic. Instead of directly setting state, you dispatch "actions" that describe what happened, and a "reducer" function determines how the state should change based on that action. This pattern makes state updates more predictable and easier to test.

The reducer pattern is especially useful when you have state with multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one in complex ways. It's also the foundation for Redux, so learning `useReducer` prepares you for more advanced state management libraries.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand how to use `useReducer` for managing complex state logic. You'll be able to write reducer functions, dispatch actions, and combine `useReducer` with Context API for powerful global state management. This knowledge gives you a more sophisticated tool for state management when `useState` isn't enough.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **`useReducer` Hook:** A React hook that manages state using a reducer function, useful for complex state logic.
*   **Reducer Function:** A pure function that takes the current state and an action, and returns the new state.
*   **Action:** An object that describes what happened and contains information needed to update the state (typically has a `type` and optional `payload`).
*   **Dispatch:** A function returned by `useReducer` that sends actions to the reducer to trigger state updates.
*   **Action Type:** A string constant that identifies the type of action being performed (e.g., `'ADD_TODO'`, `'DELETE_TODO'`).
*   **Pure Function:** A function that always returns the same output for the same input and has no side effects.
