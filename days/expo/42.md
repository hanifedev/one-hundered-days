# Day 42: API Integration (I) - Using Axios for HTTP Requests

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Introduction to Axios:** Understand why Axios is preferred over `fetch()` for many developers (better error handling, request/response interceptors, automatic JSON parsing).
2.  **Install Axios:** Install the `axios` package in your Expo project.
3.  **Axios Configuration:** Learn how to configure Axios with base URLs, default headers, and timeout settings.
4.  **Making GET Requests with Axios:** Convert your previous `fetch()` requests to use Axios and see the difference in syntax.
5.  **Error Handling with Axios:** Learn how Axios handles errors differently from `fetch()` and how to catch and handle API errors properly.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Axios is a popular HTTP client library that many developers prefer over `fetch()` because it provides better error handling, automatic JSON parsing, and more intuitive syntax. While `fetch()` is built-in and works fine, Axios offers a more developer-friendly API that can make your code cleaner and easier to maintain.

Understanding how to configure Axios (like setting a base URL for all requests) will save you time as your app grows. Proper error handling is crucial—network requests can fail for many reasons (no internet, server errors, timeouts), and you need to handle these gracefully to provide a good user experience.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be comfortable using Axios for making HTTP requests in your React Native applications. You'll understand how to configure Axios, make GET requests, and handle errors properly. This knowledge will make your API integration code more robust and maintainable.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Axios:** A popular JavaScript library for making HTTP requests, often preferred over `fetch()` for its better API and error handling.
*   **Base URL:** A common URL prefix that can be configured once and reused for all API requests.
*   **Request Interceptor:** A function that runs before a request is sent, useful for adding headers or modifying requests.
*   **Response Interceptor:** A function that runs after a response is received, useful for handling common response transformations.
*   **Timeout:** The maximum time to wait for a request to complete before considering it failed.
