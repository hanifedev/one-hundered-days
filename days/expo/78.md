# Day 78: Animations (I) - Interpolation and Transformations

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understanding Interpolation:** Learn what interpolation is and how to use `interpolate()` to map one range of values to another.
2.  **Value Interpolation:** Use interpolation to create complex animations (e.g., rotate while fading, change color during animation).
3.  **Transform Animations:** Learn how to animate transform properties (translate, scale, rotate) using `Animated.View` with `transform`.
4.  **Combining Animations:** Combine multiple animated values and transformations to create complex animations.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Build animated components that use interpolation and transformations (e.g., a card that rotates and scales, a button that moves and changes color).

## 📖 Task Explanations

Interpolation is powerful—it allows you to map one range of values to another. For example, you can animate opacity from 0 to 1 while simultaneously rotating from 0 to 360 degrees, all driven by a single animated value. This creates smooth, coordinated animations.

Transform animations (translate, scale, rotate) are commonly used for UI interactions. They're performant because they can be handled by the native layer. Combining multiple transforms and interpolations allows you to create sophisticated animations.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand interpolation and how to animate transform properties. You'll be able to create complex animations that combine multiple properties and transformations. This knowledge enables you to create polished, professional animations in your apps.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Interpolation:** The process of mapping one range of values to another range (e.g., mapping 0-1 to 0-360 for rotation).
*   **`interpolate()`:** A function that creates a mapping between input and output ranges for animations.
*   **Transform:** CSS-like properties that modify an element's appearance (translate, scale, rotate).
*   **Transform Animation:** Animating transform properties to create motion, scaling, or rotation effects.
*   **Coordinate Animation:** Animating multiple properties together to create coordinated, complex animations.
