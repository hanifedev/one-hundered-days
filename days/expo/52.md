# Day 52: State Management - Redux Actions and Reducers

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Creating Actions:** Learn how to create action creators using Redux Toolkit's `createSlice` or traditional action creators.
2.  **Writing Reducers:** Understand how to write reducers that handle different action types and update state immutably.
3.  **Redux Toolkit Slices:** Learn how to use `createSlice` to define actions and reducers together, reducing boilerplate code.
4.  **Combining Reducers:** Understand how to combine multiple reducers using `combineReducers` to manage different parts of your state.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Create a Redux store with actions and reducers for a simple feature (e.g., a counter, todo list, or user preferences).

## 📖 Task Explanations

Actions and reducers are the heart of Redux. Actions describe what happened (like "user logged in" or "item added to cart"), and reducers determine how the state should change in response. Redux Toolkit's `createSlice` makes this much easier by automatically generating action creators and action types.

It's crucial to write reducers as pure functions that don't mutate state—instead, they return new state objects. This ensures predictability and enables features like time-travel debugging. Combining reducers allows you to split your state management into logical domains (user, cart, products) for better organization.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to create Redux actions and reducers using both traditional methods and Redux Toolkit. You'll understand how to structure your Redux logic, combine multiple reducers, and write immutable state updates. This knowledge enables you to build scalable state management solutions with Redux.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Action Creator:** A function that creates and returns an action object.
*   **`createSlice`:** A Redux Toolkit function that automatically generates action creators and action types based on reducer functions you write.
*   **Immutable Updates:** Updating state by creating new objects/arrays instead of modifying existing ones, ensuring state predictability.
*   **`combineReducers`:** A Redux function that combines multiple reducers into a single reducer function.
*   **Slice:** A collection of Redux reducer logic and actions for a single feature, defined together in one file.
*   **Pure Function:** A function that always returns the same output for the same input and has no side effects.
