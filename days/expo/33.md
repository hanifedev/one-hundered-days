# Day 33: User Input & Project - Form Validation

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Introduction to Form Validation:** Understand why form validation is important and the common validation patterns.
2.  **Manual Validation:** Learn how to implement basic validation logic using conditional statements and state.
3.  **Introduction to Formik:** Get familiar with the `Formik` library, a popular form management library for React and React Native.
4.  **Formik Setup:** Learn how to install and set up Formik in your Expo project.
5.  **Basic Formik Usage:** Create a form using Formik's `Formik` component and `Field` component, implementing basic validation rules.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Form validation ensures that users provide correct and complete information. While you can implement validation manually, libraries like Formik make it much easier to manage form state, validation, and submission. Formik handles the complexity of form management, allowing you to focus on your validation logic and user experience.

Today you'll learn both approaches: manual validation for simple cases, and Formik for more complex forms. Understanding manual validation helps you appreciate what Formik does under the hood, while learning Formik will make you more efficient in building production-ready forms.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to validate user input in your React Native forms. You'll understand both manual validation techniques and how to use Formik for more complex form management. This knowledge is crucial for building robust applications that handle user input correctly.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Form Validation:** The process of checking that user input meets certain criteria (e.g., email format, required fields, password strength).
*   **Formik:** A popular library for building forms in React and React Native that simplifies form state management and validation.
*   **Validation Rules:** Criteria that input must meet to be considered valid (e.g., required, min length, email format).
*   **Error State:** State that tracks validation errors and displays them to the user.
*   **`Field`:** A Formik component that connects an input to Formik's form state and validation.
