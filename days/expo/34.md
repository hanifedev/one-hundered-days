# Day 34: User Input & Project - Building a To-Do App (Part 1)

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Project Planning:** Plan your To-Do app structure—decide on features (add, delete, mark as complete, edit).
2.  **Set Up Project Structure:** Create the necessary components and organize your project files.
3.  **Implement Add Functionality:** Create a form with `TextInput` and a button to add new to-do items.
4.  **Implement Display Functionality:** Use `FlatList` to display all to-do items.
5.  **Basic Styling:** Apply styling to make your app visually appealing and user-friendly.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today you'll start building your first complete mobile application—a To-Do app. This project will combine everything you've learned so far: React components, state management with `useState`, `TextInput` for user input, `FlatList` for displaying lists, and styling. This is a significant milestone that will demonstrate your ability to build a functional React Native application.

Start with the core functionality: adding and displaying to-do items. Focus on getting the basic structure working before adding more advanced features. This iterative approach is how professional developers build applications.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have a working To-Do app that can add and display items. You'll have practical experience combining multiple React Native concepts into a cohesive application. This project will serve as a foundation for adding more features tomorrow and will be a great addition to your portfolio.
