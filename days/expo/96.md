# Day 96: CI/CD & Final Project - Introduction to Expo EAS

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understanding EAS:** Learn what Expo Application Services (EAS) is and how it simplifies building and deploying apps.
2.  **EAS Build:** Understand what EAS Build is and how it builds native apps in the cloud.
3.  **EAS Setup:** Install EAS CLI and set up EAS in your Expo project.
4.  **EAS Configuration:** Learn how to configure `eas.json` for different build profiles (development, preview, production).
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Set up EAS in a project and create a development build configuration.

## 📖 Task Explanations

EAS (Expo Application Services) is Expo's cloud-based service for building and deploying React Native apps. It eliminates the need for local native development environments (Xcode, Android Studio) by building apps in the cloud. Understanding EAS is essential for professional React Native development.

EAS Build allows you to create native builds (APK, IPA) without setting up complex native toolchains. This makes it accessible for JavaScript developers to build and deploy native apps. EAS is the modern way to build Expo apps for production.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand EAS and how to set it up in your Expo projects. You'll know how to configure build profiles and understand the EAS workflow. This knowledge enables you to build and deploy React Native apps professionally.
