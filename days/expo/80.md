# Day 80: Animations (I) - Interactive Animations and Gestures

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Interactive Animations:** Learn how to create animations that respond to user gestures (pan, pinch, swipe).
2.  **Animated Events:** Use `Animated.event()` to bind animated values directly to gesture handlers.
3.  **Pan Responder:** Learn how to use `PanResponder` with Animated API to create drag-and-drop animations.
4.  **Gesture-Driven Animations:** Create animations that follow user input (e.g., dragging a card, pulling to refresh).
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Build interactive animated components (e.g., a draggable card, a swipeable list item, a pull-to-refresh animation).

## 📖 Task Explanations

Interactive animations respond to user input, creating engaging, responsive interfaces. Using `Animated.event()` allows you to directly bind gesture values to animated values, making it easy to create animations that follow user gestures.

PanResponder provides low-level control over touch gestures, allowing you to create custom drag interactions. Combining PanResponder with Animated API enables you to create sophisticated interactive animations like draggable cards, swipeable items, and pull-to-refresh.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand how to create interactive animations that respond to user gestures. You'll be able to use Animated.event() and PanResponder to create drag-and-drop and gesture-driven animations. This knowledge enables you to build engaging, interactive user interfaces with smooth animations.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Interactive Animation:** An animation that responds to and follows user input (gestures, touches).
*   **`Animated.event()`:** A function that maps gesture values directly to animated values, creating gesture-driven animations.
*   **PanResponder:** A React Native API that provides low-level control over touch gestures.
*   **Gesture Handler:** Code that responds to user gestures (pan, pinch, swipe, etc.).
*   **Drag Animation:** An animation where an element follows the user's finger as they drag it.
