# Day 84: Animations (II) - Moti as an Alternative

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Introduction to Moti:** Learn what Moti is and how it simplifies animations in React Native.
2.  **Moti Setup:** Install `moti` in your Expo project.
3.  **Basic Moti Animations:** Create animations using Moti's declarative API with `from` and `to` props.
4.  **Moti vs Reanimated:** Understand when to use Moti vs Reanimated (simplicity vs. power).
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Build animated components using Moti and compare the developer experience to Reanimated.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Moti is a declarative animation library built on top of Reanimated that simplifies creating animations. Instead of managing shared values and animated styles, Moti provides a simpler, more intuitive API. It's great for developers who want powerful animations with less boilerplate.

While Reanimated gives you more control and power, Moti provides a better developer experience for common animation patterns. Understanding both tools helps you choose the right one for each project.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand Moti and how it compares to Reanimated. You'll be able to create animations using Moti's declarative API. This knowledge gives you flexibility in choosing animation tools based on your project's needs.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Moti:** A declarative animation library for React Native built on Reanimated.
*   **Declarative API:** An API where you describe what you want (the end state) rather than how to achieve it (imperative).
*   **Animation Props:** Properties you pass to components to define animations (like `from`, `to`, `animate`).
*   **Boilerplate:** Repetitive code that must be written to accomplish common tasks.
*   **Developer Experience:** How easy and pleasant it is to use a tool or library.
