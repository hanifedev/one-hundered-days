# Day 95: Performance Optimization - Advanced Optimization Techniques

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Code Splitting:** Understand code splitting concepts and how to reduce bundle size in React Native.
2.  **Lazy Loading:** Learn how to lazy load components and screens to improve initial load time.
3.  **Memory Management:** Understand memory leaks in React Native and how to prevent them (cleaning up subscriptions, timers).
4.  **Bundle Optimization:** Learn techniques for reducing app bundle size (tree shaking, removing unused code).
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Optimize an existing app by implementing lazy loading, cleaning up memory leaks, and reducing bundle size.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Advanced optimization techniques help improve app startup time and reduce memory usage. Code splitting and lazy loading reduce initial bundle size, making apps load faster. Memory management prevents leaks that can cause apps to slow down or crash over time.

Understanding bundle optimization helps you keep app sizes reasonable, which is important for user adoption (smaller apps download faster and use less storage). These advanced techniques are essential for production-ready apps.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand advanced performance optimization techniques. You'll know how to implement lazy loading, manage memory properly, and optimize bundle sizes. This knowledge enables you to build highly optimized, production-ready applications.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Code Splitting:** The practice of splitting code into smaller chunks that are loaded on demand.
*   **Lazy Loading:** Loading code or components only when they're needed, reducing initial load time.
*   **Memory Leak:** A bug where memory is allocated but never freed, causing gradual memory consumption.
*   **Bundle Size:** The total size of JavaScript code in your app, affecting download and startup time.
*   **Tree Shaking:** The process of removing unused code from the final bundle.


## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Performance Best Practices:** Learn general performance best practices for React Native (code splitting, bundle optimization, lazy loading).
2.  **Common Performance Patterns:** Understand common patterns for optimizing performance (debouncing, throttling, batching updates).
3.  **Memory Optimization:** Learn techniques for reducing memory usage (cleaning up subscriptions, avoiding memory leaks).
4.  **Network Optimization:** Optimize API calls and data fetching (caching, request batching, reducing payload size).
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Review and optimize an existing app, applying performance best practices throughout.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Performance optimization involves many considerations beyond just React optimizations. Code splitting reduces initial bundle size, lazy loading defers loading until needed, and proper cleanup prevents memory leaks. Understanding these patterns helps you build consistently performant apps.

Network optimization is also important—caching responses, batching requests, and reducing payload sizes all improve performance. These optimizations work together to create fast, responsive applications.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand comprehensive performance optimization best practices for React Native. You'll know patterns for optimizing code, memory, and network usage. This knowledge enables you to build consistently performant applications.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Code Splitting:** Breaking code into smaller chunks that are loaded only when needed.
*   **Debouncing:** Delaying a function call until after a period of inactivity (useful for search inputs).
*   **Throttling:** Limiting how often a function can be called (useful for scroll handlers).
*   **Memory Leak:** When memory is allocated but never freed, causing memory usage to grow over time.
*   **Request Batching:** Combining multiple API requests into a single request to reduce network overhead.
