# Day 71: Component Testing - Introduction to React Native Testing Library

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Introduction to Component Testing:** Understand what component testing is and how it differs from unit testing.
2.  **React Native Testing Library:** Learn about React Native Testing Library and its philosophy (testing from the user's perspective).
3.  **Setting Up Testing Library:** Install and configure React Native Testing Library in your Expo project.
4.  **Basic Component Test:** Write your first component test, rendering a component and making basic assertions.
5.  **Query Methods:** Learn the basic query methods (`getByText`, `getByTestId`, etc.) and when to use each.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Component testing focuses on testing React components from the user's perspective—what they see and interact with, rather than implementation details. React Native Testing Library encourages this approach, making tests more resilient to refactoring and focused on user experience.

Understanding query methods is crucial—they allow you to find elements in your rendered component. The Testing Library philosophy is to query elements the way users would find them (by text, role, etc.) rather than by implementation details (like class names or test IDs, though test IDs are sometimes necessary).

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand component testing and be able to write basic tests using React Native Testing Library. You'll know how to render components, query elements, and make assertions. This knowledge is the foundation for testing your UI components effectively.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Component Testing:** Testing React components to verify they render correctly and behave as expected.
*   **React Native Testing Library:** A testing utility library that helps you test React Native components from the user's perspective.
*   **Query Method:** A function that finds elements in a rendered component (e.g., `getByText`, `getByTestId`).
*   **User-Centric Testing:** Testing from the user's perspective, focusing on what users see and do rather than implementation details.
*   **Rendering:** The process of converting a React component into a test representation that can be queried and tested.
