# Day 83: Animations (II) - Reanimated Advanced Patterns

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Interpolation in Reanimated:** Learn how to use `interpolate` and `Extrapolate` in Reanimated for value mapping.
2.  **Spring and Timing:** Use `withSpring` and `withTiming` for different animation types in Reanimated.
3.  **Animation Sequences:** Create animation sequences using `withSequence` and `withDelay`.
4.  **Shared Values Updates:** Learn how to update shared values and trigger animations programmatically.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Build complex animations using Reanimated's advanced features (spring animations, sequences, interpolations).

## 📖 Task Explanations

Reanimated provides powerful animation functions like `withSpring` and `withTiming` that work with shared values. These functions run on the UI thread, providing smooth animations. Interpolation in Reanimated is similar to Animated API but more powerful and performant.

Understanding how to sequence animations and update shared values programmatically enables you to create sophisticated animation flows. These patterns are essential for building polished, professional animations.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand advanced Reanimated patterns including interpolation, spring/timing animations, and sequences. You'll be able to create complex, performant animations using Reanimated's full feature set. This knowledge enables you to build production-ready animated interfaces.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **`withSpring`:** A Reanimated function that creates spring-based animations.
*   **`withTiming`:** A Reanimated function that creates timing-based animations.
*   **`withSequence`:** A Reanimated function that chains animations together.
*   **`withDelay`:** A Reanimated function that delays the start of an animation.
*   **Extrapolate:** A configuration that determines how values outside the interpolation range are handled.
