# Day 63: Architectural Approach - Service Layer Pattern

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understanding Service Layer:** Learn what a service layer is and why it's useful for organizing API calls and business logic.
2.  **Creating API Services:** Build service files that encapsulate all API calls for a specific domain (e.g., `userService`, `productService`).
3.  **Service Functions:** Create reusable service functions that handle API requests, error handling, and data transformation.
4.  **Using Services in Components:** Learn how to use service functions in your components instead of making API calls directly.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Refactor an existing app to use a service layer, moving all API calls into service files.

## 📖 Task Explanations

A service layer is a common architectural pattern where you create separate files (services) that handle all interactions with external systems (APIs, databases, etc.). This centralizes your API logic, makes it easier to test, and allows you to change your data source without modifying components.

Services typically contain functions that make API calls and return data in a format your app can use. This separation makes your codebase more organized and allows multiple components to reuse the same API logic without duplication.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand how to create and use a service layer in your React Native applications. You'll be able to organize API calls into reusable service functions, making your code more maintainable and testable. This knowledge is essential for building professional, scalable applications.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Service Layer:** A layer of code that handles business logic and interactions with external systems (APIs, databases).
*   **API Service:** A service file that encapsulates all API calls related to a specific domain or resource.
*   **Service Function:** A function in a service file that performs a specific operation (e.g., `getUser`, `createPost`).
*   **Centralized Logic:** Organizing related functionality in one place, making it easier to maintain and modify.
*   **Abstraction Layer:** A layer that hides implementation details and provides a simpler interface for the rest of the application.
