# Day 69: Unit Testing (Jest) - Mocking and Test Doubles

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understanding Mocking:** Learn what mocking is and why it's necessary for testing (isolating code, controlling dependencies).
2.  **Jest Mocks:** Learn how to create mocks using `jest.fn()`, `jest.mock()`, and `jest.spyOn()`.
3.  **Mocking Functions:** Mock functions and modules to control their behavior in tests.
4.  **Mocking API Calls:** Learn how to mock API calls and external dependencies to test code in isolation.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Write tests that use mocks for API calls, AsyncStorage, and other external dependencies.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Mocking is essential for unit testing because it allows you to isolate the code you're testing from its dependencies. Instead of making real API calls or accessing real storage, you create mocks that simulate those dependencies. This makes tests faster, more reliable, and independent of external systems.

Jest provides powerful mocking capabilities. Understanding when and how to mock dependencies is crucial for writing effective tests. Mocking API calls is especially important because you don't want your tests to depend on network connectivity or external services.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand how to use mocks in your tests. You'll be able to mock functions, modules, and external dependencies, allowing you to test code in isolation. This knowledge is essential for writing comprehensive unit tests that don't depend on external systems.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Mocking:** The practice of creating fake implementations of dependencies for testing purposes.
*   **Mock Function:** A fake function that simulates the behavior of a real function, allowing you to control its return value and track calls.
*   **Test Double:** A general term for fake objects used in testing (mocks, stubs, spies).
*   **Dependency Isolation:** Testing code in isolation by replacing its dependencies with mocks.
*   **`jest.fn()`:** A Jest function that creates a mock function.
*   **`jest.mock()`:** A Jest function that mocks an entire module.
