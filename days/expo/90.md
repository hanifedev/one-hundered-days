# Day 90: Expo SDK & Native Access - Practice Project

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Project Goal:** Build a complete feature that uses multiple Expo SDK modules (camera, location, notifications, etc.).
2.  **Feature Integration:** Integrate at least 3-4 different native features in your project.
3.  **Permission Handling:** Properly handle all permission requests and edge cases.
4.  **User Experience:** Ensure the feature provides a smooth, intuitive experience when using device capabilities.
5.  **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling for cases where features aren't available or permissions are denied.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today you'll consolidate your Expo SDK knowledge by building a feature that uses multiple device capabilities. This project should demonstrate your ability to integrate native features, handle permissions, and create a polished user experience.

Real-world apps often combine multiple device features (like a social app that uses camera, location, and notifications). Understanding how to integrate these features smoothly is essential for professional development.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have built a feature that integrates multiple Expo SDK modules. You'll have practical experience with permissions, error handling, and creating smooth user experiences with native features. This project demonstrates your ability to build apps that leverage device capabilities.
