# Day 64: Architectural Approach - TypeScript and Type Organization

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Type Organization:** Learn how to organize TypeScript types, interfaces, and enums in your project (types folder, shared types).
2.  **Type Definitions:** Create type definition files for your services, components, and data models.
3.  **Reusable Types:** Learn how to create reusable types and interfaces that can be shared across your application.
4.  **Type Safety in Services:** Ensure your service layer functions are properly typed with TypeScript.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Add comprehensive TypeScript types to an existing project, organizing them in a clear structure.

## 📖 Task Explanations

As your application grows, organizing TypeScript types becomes crucial. Having a clear structure for types (like a `types` folder with domain-specific type files) makes it easier to find and maintain type definitions. Well-organized types also improve code discoverability and prevent type-related bugs.

Type safety in services ensures that API responses and function parameters are properly typed, catching errors at compile-time rather than runtime. This is especially important as your app scales and multiple developers work on it.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand how to organize TypeScript types effectively in your React Native projects. You'll be able to create a clear type structure, ensure type safety across your application, and maintain type definitions as your project grows. This knowledge is essential for building maintainable, type-safe applications.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Type Organization:** The practice of structuring TypeScript types, interfaces, and enums in a logical, maintainable way.
*   **Type Definition File:** A file (typically `.ts` or `.d.ts`) that contains TypeScript type definitions.
*   **Shared Types:** Types that are used across multiple files or modules in an application.
*   **Type Safety:** The guarantee that types are correct at compile-time, preventing type-related runtime errors.
*   **Type Structure:** The organization and hierarchy of types in a project, making them easy to find and maintain.
