## 📖 Task Explanations

CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) automates testing, building, and deploying your app. This saves time and ensures code quality by running tests automatically and catching issues early. GitHub Actions is a popular tool for setting up CI/CD workflows.

Automated testing ensures your code works correctly before it's merged. Automated builds ensure you always have up-to-date builds available. Understanding CI/CD is essential for professional development workflows.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand CI/CD concepts and how to set up basic automation for your Expo projects. You'll know how to automate testing and builds. This knowledge enables you to work more efficiently and maintain code quality.
