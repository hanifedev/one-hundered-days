# Day 50: State Management - Context API Practice Project

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Project Goal:** Build a complete application that demonstrates your mastery of Context API and `useReducer` (e.g., a shopping cart app, a task management app with teams, or a theme switcher app).
2.  **Multiple Contexts:** Implement at least 2-3 different contexts for different domains (e.g., `AuthContext`, `CartContext`, `ThemeContext`).
3.  **Complex State Logic:** Use `useReducer` for at least one context that has complex state updates (multiple actions, nested state).
4.  **Performance Optimization:** Apply optimization techniques (context splitting, `React.memo()`) to ensure good performance.
5.  **Polish:** Ensure proper error handling, loading states, and a polished user experience throughout the application.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today you'll consolidate all your Context API knowledge by building a complete application that uses multiple contexts and `useReducer`. This project will demonstrate your ability to manage complex global state without external libraries, using only React's built-in features.

Choose a project that requires multiple types of global state (authentication, shopping cart, user preferences) to practice working with multiple contexts. Pay attention to performance—use the optimization techniques you've learned to ensure your app remains fast even as state complexity grows.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have built a complete React Native application that demonstrates advanced state management using Context API and `useReducer`. You'll have practical experience with multiple contexts, complex state logic, performance optimization, and building production-ready state management solutions. This project showcases your ability to manage state effectively and will be a valuable addition to your portfolio.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **State Management Architecture:** The overall structure and organization of state management in an application.
*   **Domain Separation:** Organizing state by business domain (authentication, e-commerce, user preferences) rather than by technical concerns.
*   **Production-Ready:** Code that is well-structured, performant, and ready for real-world use.
*   **State Complexity:** The level of complexity in managing state, including nested objects, arrays, and interdependent state values.
*   **Scalable State Management:** A state management solution that can grow with your application without becoming unmaintainable.
