# Day 92: Performance Optimization - List Performance

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **FlatList Optimization:** Learn how to optimize FlatList performance (keyExtractor, getItemLayout, removeClippedSubviews).
2.  **Virtualization:** Understand how FlatList virtualizes items (only rendering visible items) and how to optimize it.
3.  **List Item Optimization:** Optimize list items using React.memo and proper key extraction.
4.  **Large Lists:** Learn techniques for handling very large lists (pagination, windowing, lazy loading).
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Optimize a FlatList that displays a large dataset, ensuring smooth scrolling performance.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Lists are common in mobile apps and can be performance bottlenecks if not optimized. FlatList is already optimized with virtualization, but there are additional optimizations you can apply. Understanding how FlatList works (rendering only visible items) helps you optimize effectively.

Large lists require special consideration—you might need pagination, infinite scroll, or other techniques to handle thousands of items. Proper optimization ensures smooth scrolling even with large datasets.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand how to optimize FlatList performance for large datasets. You'll know techniques for improving list rendering and scrolling performance. This knowledge enables you to build apps that handle large lists smoothly.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **List Virtualization:** Rendering only visible list items, improving performance for large lists.
*   **FlatList:** React Native's optimized list component that virtualizes items.
*   **keyExtractor:** A function that extracts unique keys for list items, improving performance.
*   **getItemLayout:** A function that provides item dimensions, allowing FlatList to optimize rendering.
*   **Pagination:** Loading data in chunks (pages) rather than all at once.
