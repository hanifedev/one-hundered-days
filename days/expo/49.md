# Day 49: State Management - Advanced Context Patterns

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Context Performance Optimization:** Learn how to prevent unnecessary re-renders by splitting contexts and using `React.memo()`.
2.  **Context Composition:** Understand how to compose multiple contexts together for complex state management scenarios.
3.  **Default Values:** Learn how to provide default values for context and handle cases where context is used outside its provider.
4.  **Context Testing:** Understand strategies for testing components that use context (mocking context values).
5.  **Best Practices:** Learn common patterns and best practices for using Context API effectively in production applications.

## 📖 Task Explanations

As your app grows, you might notice performance issues with Context API—every time context value changes, all consuming components re-render. You can optimize this by splitting contexts (so only relevant components re-render) and using `React.memo()` to prevent unnecessary re-renders of child components.

Context composition allows you to combine multiple contexts in a clean way, which is useful for complex applications. Understanding best practices (like when to use Context vs. local state, how to structure contexts) will help you build maintainable applications that perform well.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand advanced Context API patterns and optimization techniques. You'll be able to build performant, well-structured state management solutions using Context API. This knowledge enables you to use Context API effectively in production applications without running into common performance pitfalls.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Context Composition:** The practice of combining multiple contexts together to manage different aspects of application state.
*   **`React.memo()`:** A higher-order component that prevents a component from re-rendering unless its props have changed.
*   **Performance Optimization:** Techniques used to improve the speed and efficiency of an application.
*   **Unnecessary Re-renders:** When a component re-renders even though its props and state haven't changed, wasting resources.
*   **Context Splitting:** The practice of creating separate contexts for different concerns to minimize re-renders.
*   **Mocking:** Creating fake implementations of dependencies (like context) for testing purposes.
