## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Expo Camera:** Learn how to use `expo-camera` to access device camera and take photos.
2.  **Camera Permissions:** Understand how to request and handle camera permissions.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Expo provides easy access to device features like the camera through its SDK. The `expo-camera` package allows you to access the camera without writing native code. Understanding permissions is crucial—you need to request camera and media library permissions before accessing these features.

Image picker provides a simple way to let users select images from their device. Combining camera and image picker gives users flexibility in how they add images to your app. These features are essential for many app types (social media, productivity, e-commerce).

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to access device camera and media library in your Expo applications. You'll understand how to request permissions, take photos, and handle images. This knowledge enables you to build apps that interact with device hardware.
