# Day 39: Navigation - Parameter Passing

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Passing Parameters:** Learn how to pass data (parameters) when navigating to a screen using `navigation.navigate('ScreenName', { param1: value1 })`.
2.  **Receiving Parameters:** Understand how to access parameters in the destination screen using `route.params`.
3.  **TypeScript with Navigation:** Learn how to type navigation parameters using TypeScript for type safety.
4.  **Updating Parameters:** Understand how to update parameters using `navigation.setParams()`.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Enhance your To-Do app by adding a detail screen that receives the selected to-do item as a parameter.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Passing parameters between screens is essential for building dynamic applications. For example, when a user taps on a to-do item, you need to pass that item's data to the detail screen. React Navigation makes this easy with route parameters.

Using TypeScript with navigation ensures type safety—you'll know exactly what parameters each screen expects, preventing runtime errors. This is especially important as your app grows and navigation becomes more complex. Understanding parameter passing is crucial for building data-driven applications.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to pass data between screens in your React Native applications. You'll understand how to send parameters when navigating, receive them in destination screens, and type them properly with TypeScript. This knowledge enables you to build dynamic, data-driven applications where screens can display and modify data passed from other screens.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Navigation Parameters:** Data passed from one screen to another during navigation.
*   **`route.params`:** An object containing the parameters passed to the current screen.
*   **`navigation.setParams()`:** A method to update the parameters of the current screen.
*   **Type-Safe Navigation:** Using TypeScript to ensure navigation parameters match expected types, preventing errors.
*   **Route:** An object that contains information about the current screen, including its parameters.
