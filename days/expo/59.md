# Day 59: Custom Hooks - Creating Reusable Logic

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understanding Custom Hooks:** Learn what custom hooks are and why they're useful (reusing stateful logic, keeping components clean, sharing logic between components).
2.  **Custom Hook Rules:** Understand the rules of hooks (only call hooks at the top level, only call hooks from React functions).
3.  **Creating Your First Custom Hook:** Build a simple custom hook (e.g., `useToggle`, `useCounter`, `useLocalStorage`).
4.  **Custom Hooks with AsyncStorage:** Create a custom hook that wraps AsyncStorage operations (e.g., `useAsyncStorage`).
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Refactor existing code to use custom hooks, extracting reusable logic from components.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Custom hooks are a powerful React feature that allows you to extract component logic into reusable functions. They let you share stateful logic between components without duplicating code. Custom hooks must follow the rules of hooks (start with "use", only call other hooks from within them).

Creating custom hooks for common patterns (like AsyncStorage, API calls, form handling) makes your code more maintainable and testable. They're one of the best ways to share logic in React applications and are widely used in production codebases.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand how to create and use custom hooks in your React Native applications. You'll be able to extract reusable logic from components, create hooks for common patterns, and write cleaner, more maintainable code. This knowledge is essential for building scalable React Native applications.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Custom Hook:** A JavaScript function that starts with "use" and may call other hooks, allowing you to extract and reuse component logic.
*   **Stateful Logic:** Logic that involves state management, side effects, or other React hooks.
*   **Hook Rules:** The rules that must be followed when using hooks (only call at top level, only call from React functions).
*   **Logic Extraction:** The process of moving logic out of components into reusable functions (like custom hooks).
*   **Reusable Code:** Code that can be used in multiple places without duplication, improving maintainability.
