# Day 72: Component Testing - Testing User Interactions

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Fire Events:** Learn how to simulate user interactions (press, change text, scroll) using `fireEvent` from Testing Library.
2.  **Testing Button Clicks:** Test that buttons trigger the correct actions when pressed.
3.  **Testing Input Changes:** Test that TextInput components handle user input correctly.
4.  **Testing State Updates:** Verify that user interactions update component state and trigger re-renders correctly.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Write tests for interactive components (forms, buttons, toggles) that verify user interactions work correctly.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Testing user interactions is crucial for ensuring your UI works correctly. React Native Testing Library provides `fireEvent` to simulate user actions like pressing buttons, typing in inputs, and scrolling. These tests verify that your components respond correctly to user input.

Testing state updates ensures that when users interact with your components, the state changes as expected and the UI updates accordingly. This is essential for interactive components like forms, toggles, and buttons.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to test user interactions in your React Native components. You'll know how to simulate button presses, input changes, and other user actions, and verify that components respond correctly. This knowledge ensures your UI is interactive and works as users expect.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **User Interaction:** Actions that users perform on UI elements (clicks, typing, swiping, etc.).
*   **`fireEvent`:** A utility from Testing Library that simulates user events (press, change, scroll, etc.).
*   **Event Simulation:** The practice of programmatically triggering user events in tests.
*   **Interaction Testing:** Testing that components respond correctly to user interactions.
*   **State Update Verification:** Confirming that user interactions correctly update component state.
