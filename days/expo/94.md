# Day 94: Performance Optimization - Debugging and Profiling

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Performance Debugging:** Learn how to identify performance issues using React DevTools and React Native Debugger.
2.  **Flipper Integration:** Understand how to use Flipper for debugging React Native apps (network, layout, performance).
3.  **Performance Monitoring:** Learn how to measure and monitor app performance (render times, frame rates).
4.  **Profiling Tools:** Explore tools for profiling React Native apps and identifying bottlenecks.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Profile an existing app, identify performance issues, and optimize them using the tools you've learned.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Debugging performance issues requires the right tools. React DevTools helps identify unnecessary re-renders. Flipper provides comprehensive debugging capabilities including network monitoring, layout inspection, and performance profiling. Understanding how to use these tools is essential for optimizing apps.

Performance monitoring helps you measure improvements and identify regressions. Profiling tools show you where time is spent, making it easier to optimize the right parts of your code. These skills are crucial for maintaining app performance as features are added.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand how to debug and profile React Native applications. You'll know how to use React DevTools, Flipper, and other profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks. This knowledge enables you to systematically improve app performance.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers
