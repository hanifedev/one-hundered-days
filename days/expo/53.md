# Day 53: State Management - Connecting Redux to React Native

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Redux Provider:** Learn how to wrap your app with the Redux `Provider` component to make the store available to all components.
2.  **`useSelector` Hook:** Understand how to use the `useSelector` hook to read data from the Redux store in your components.
3.  **`useDispatch` Hook:** Learn how to use the `useDispatch` hook to dispatch actions from your components.
4.  **Selectors:** Understand how to create reusable selectors to extract and transform data from the store.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Connect your Redux store to React Native components and build a simple app that uses Redux for state management.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Connecting Redux to React Native components is done through the `react-redux` library. The `Provider` component makes the Redux store available to all components in your app. `useSelector` lets components read data from the store, and `useDispatch` lets them dispatch actions to update the store.

Selectors are functions that extract specific pieces of data from the store. They can also compute derived data (like filtering a list or calculating totals). Using selectors keeps your components clean and makes your data access logic reusable and testable.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to connect Redux to your React Native components. You'll know how to read from and write to the Redux store using hooks, and how to create reusable selectors. This knowledge enables you to build React Native applications that use Redux for state management.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Redux Provider:** A component from `react-redux` that makes the Redux store available to all child components.
*   **`useSelector` Hook:** A React hook from `react-redux` that allows components to read data from the Redux store.
*   **`useDispatch` Hook:** A React hook from `react-redux` that returns a reference to the `dispatch` function for dispatching actions.
*   **Selector:** A function that extracts specific data from the Redux store, often with some transformation or computation.
*   **Derived State:** Data computed from other state (e.g., total price calculated from cart items).
*   **Store Subscription:** The mechanism by which components automatically re-render when relevant parts of the store change.
