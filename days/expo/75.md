# Day 75: Component Testing - Best Practices and Test Coverage

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Testing Best Practices:** Learn best practices for writing component tests (what to test, what not to test, test organization).
2.  **Test Coverage:** Understand what test coverage means and how to measure it using coverage tools.
3.  **Test Maintenance:** Learn strategies for keeping tests maintainable as your codebase grows.
4.  **Common Testing Patterns:** Understand common patterns for testing different types of components (forms, lists, modals).
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Review and improve existing tests, ensuring they follow best practices and have good coverage.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Following testing best practices makes your tests more valuable and maintainable. Understanding what to test (user-visible behavior) and what not to test (implementation details) helps you write focused, useful tests. Test coverage metrics help you understand how much of your code is tested.

As your codebase grows, maintaining tests becomes important. Well-written tests that follow best practices are easier to update when code changes. Understanding common testing patterns helps you write tests more efficiently.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand best practices for component testing and how to measure test coverage. You'll know common testing patterns and strategies for maintaining tests. This knowledge helps you write effective, maintainable tests that provide real value.
