# Day 89: Expo SDK & Native Access - Device Features and Sensors

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Device Information:** Learn how to get device information (model, OS version, etc.) using `expo-device`.
2.  **Haptics:** Use `expo-haptics` to provide tactile feedback (vibrations) to users.
3.  **File System:** Learn how to use `expo-file-system` to read and write files on the device.
4.  **Other Expo Modules:** Explore other Expo SDK modules (Contacts, Calendar, Document Picker, etc.).
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Build a feature that uses multiple device capabilities (haptics, file system, device info).

## 📖 Task Explanations

Expo provides access to many device features through its SDK. Haptics provide tactile feedback that enhances user experience (like vibration when pressing a button). File system access allows you to save and read files, which is useful for caching, offline functionality, and data persistence.

Understanding what device features are available through Expo helps you build more capable apps. While not every app needs every feature, knowing what's available helps you make informed decisions about app functionality.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand how to access various device features through Expo SDK. You'll be able to use haptics, file system, and other device capabilities. This knowledge enables you to build apps that take full advantage of device hardware.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Haptics:** Tactile feedback (vibrations) that provide physical sensations to users.
*   **File System:** The device's storage system where files can be read and written.
*   **Device Information:** Data about the device (model, OS version, manufacturer, etc.).
*   **Expo Module:** A package in the Expo SDK that provides access to a specific device feature or capability.
*   **Native Capability:** A device feature that requires native code to access.
