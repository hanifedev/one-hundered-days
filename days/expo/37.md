# Day 37: Navigation - Stack Navigator

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Stack Navigator Deep Dive:** Understand how Stack Navigator works—it manages a stack of screens where new screens are pushed on top.
2.  **Screen Configuration:** Learn how to configure screens with options like `title`, `headerStyle`, and `headerTitleStyle`.
3.  **Navigation Methods:** Master the `navigation.navigate()`, `navigation.push()`, and `navigation.goBack()` methods.
4.  **Header Customization:** Customize the navigation header (title, buttons, styling) for each screen.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Build a simple multi-screen app (e.g., Home → Details → Settings) using Stack Navigator.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Stack Navigator is the most common navigation pattern in mobile apps. It works like a stack of cards—when you navigate to a new screen, it's pushed onto the stack. When you go back, the top screen is popped off. This pattern is intuitive for users and matches platform conventions (iOS and Android both use this pattern).

Understanding navigation methods is crucial: `navigate()` can go to a new screen or back to an existing one, `push()` always adds a new screen, and `goBack()` returns to the previous screen. Header customization allows you to create a consistent and branded navigation experience.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be proficient in using Stack Navigator to create multi-screen applications. You'll understand how to navigate between screens, customize headers, and manage the navigation stack. This knowledge enables you to build apps with proper navigation flow, which is essential for any real-world application.
