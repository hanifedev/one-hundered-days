# Day 43: API Integration (I) - POST, PUT, and DELETE Requests

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **POST Requests:** Learn how to send data to a server using POST requests (e.g., creating a new user, adding a comment).
2.  **PUT/PATCH Requests:** Understand the difference between PUT (full update) and PATCH (partial update) and when to use each.
3.  **DELETE Requests:** Learn how to delete resources from a server using DELETE requests.
4.  **Request Headers:** Understand how to set custom headers (like `Content-Type`, `Authorization`) in your requests.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Build a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) interface that interacts with an API.

## 📖 Task Explanations

While GET requests retrieve data, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests modify data on the server. POST is used to create new resources, PUT/PATCH to update existing ones, and DELETE to remove them. Understanding these HTTP methods is essential for building apps that can create, update, and delete data.

Request headers are important for authentication (sending API keys or tokens) and specifying the content type of your request body. Many APIs require specific headers to work correctly. This knowledge is crucial for integrating with real-world APIs.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to perform all CRUD operations via API requests. You'll understand how to create, read, update, and delete data using different HTTP methods. This knowledge enables you to build fully interactive applications that can modify data on remote servers.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **POST Request:** An HTTP method used to create new resources on a server.
*   **PUT Request:** An HTTP method used to fully replace an existing resource.
*   **PATCH Request:** An HTTP method used to partially update an existing resource.
*   **DELETE Request:** An HTTP method used to remove a resource from a server.
*   **Request Body:** The data sent with a request (used in POST, PUT, PATCH requests).
*   **Content-Type Header:** A header that specifies the format of the data being sent (e.g., `application/json`).
*   **CRUD:** Create, Read, Update, Delete—the four basic operations for managing data.
