# Day 87: Expo SDK & Native Access - Location and Maps

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Expo Location:** Learn how to use `expo-location` to get device location (GPS coordinates).
2.  **Location Permissions:** Understand how to request location permissions and handle different permission states.
3.  **Maps Integration:** Use `react-native-maps` or Expo's map components to display maps in your app.
4.  **Location Features:** Implement features like getting current location, watching location changes, and geocoding.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Build a feature that displays user location on a map and shows nearby points of interest.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Location services are essential for many apps (navigation, social check-ins, delivery apps). Expo Location provides easy access to GPS functionality. Understanding location permissions is crucial—users must grant permission, and you need to handle cases where permission is denied.

Maps integration allows you to display location data visually. Combining location services with maps creates powerful features like showing user location, displaying markers, and calculating distances. These features are common in production apps.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to access device location and display maps in your Expo applications. You'll understand how to request permissions, get location data, and integrate maps. This knowledge enables you to build location-aware applications.
