# Day 66: Unit Testing (Jest) - Introduction to Testing

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Why Testing Matters:** Understand the importance of testing in software development (catching bugs, enabling refactoring, documenting behavior).
2.  **Introduction to Jest:** Learn what Jest is and why it's the standard testing framework for React Native.
3.  **Jest Setup:** Set up Jest in your Expo project and understand the testing configuration.
4.  **Writing Your First Test:** Write a simple test for a utility function to understand the basic testing syntax.
5.  **Test Structure:** Learn the structure of a test (describe, it/test, expect, assertions).

## 📖 Task Explanations

Testing is a crucial skill for professional developers. It helps you catch bugs early, enables confident refactoring, and serves as documentation for how your code should work. Jest is the testing framework that comes with React Native and is widely used in the React ecosystem.

Understanding the basics of Jest (test structure, assertions, matchers) is the foundation for all testing. Even simple tests provide value by ensuring your code works as expected and continues to work as you make changes.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand why testing is important and be able to write basic tests using Jest. You'll know the fundamental testing concepts and syntax, setting the foundation for writing more complex tests. This knowledge is essential for professional development and building reliable applications.
