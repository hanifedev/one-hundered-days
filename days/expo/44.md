# Day 44: API Integration (I) - Loading and Error State Management

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Loading States:** Learn how to track when API requests are in progress using state (e.g., `isLoading`, `isFetching`).
2.  **Display Loading Indicators:** Show loading spinners or skeletons while data is being fetched.
3.  **Error States:** Implement proper error handling to catch and display API errors to users.
4.  **Error Messages:** Create user-friendly error messages that inform users what went wrong and how to fix it.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Enhance your previous API project with proper loading and error states, ensuring a smooth user experience even when things go wrong.

## 📖 Task Explanations

API requests are asynchronous and can take time to complete. Users need visual feedback that something is happening—this is where loading states come in. Showing a spinner or skeleton screen prevents users from thinking the app is frozen and improves perceived performance.

Errors are inevitable in real-world applications (network failures, server errors, invalid data). Proper error handling ensures your app doesn't crash and provides helpful feedback to users. Good error messages guide users on what to do next, improving the overall user experience.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to create robust API integrations with proper loading and error handling. Your apps will provide clear feedback to users during API operations and handle errors gracefully. This knowledge is essential for building production-ready applications that work reliably in real-world conditions.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Loading State:** A state variable that tracks whether an asynchronous operation (like an API request) is currently in progress.
*   **Loading Indicator:** A visual element (like a spinner or progress bar) that shows users that an operation is in progress.
*   **Skeleton Screen:** A placeholder UI that shows the structure of content while it's loading, providing better UX than a blank screen.
*   **Error State:** A state variable that tracks whether an operation failed and stores error information.
*   **Error Handling:** The process of catching, processing, and responding to errors in a way that prevents crashes and informs users.
