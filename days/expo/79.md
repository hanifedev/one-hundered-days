# Day 79: Animations (I) - Animation Sequences and Parallel Animations

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Animation Sequences:** Learn how to chain animations together using `Animated.sequence()` so they play one after another.
2.  **Parallel Animations:** Use `Animated.parallel()` to run multiple animations simultaneously.
3.  **Staggered Animations:** Create staggered animations where multiple elements animate with slight delays using `Animated.stagger()`.
4.  **Animation Loops:** Learn how to create looping animations using `Animated.loop()`.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Build animated components that use sequences, parallel animations, and loops (e.g., a loading spinner, a list that animates in with stagger).

## 📖 Task Explanations

Real-world animations often involve multiple steps or multiple elements animating together. Sequences allow you to chain animations (e.g., fade in, then slide, then fade out). Parallel animations let you animate multiple properties simultaneously (e.g., fade and scale at the same time).

Staggered animations create beautiful effects where list items animate in one after another with slight delays. Looping animations are useful for loading indicators and continuous animations. Understanding these patterns enables you to create sophisticated animation sequences.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand how to create animation sequences, run animations in parallel, and create staggered and looping animations. You'll be able to orchestrate complex animation behaviors. This knowledge enables you to create polished, professional animations with multiple steps and coordinated motion.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Animation Sequence:** A series of animations that play one after another in order.
*   **Parallel Animation:** Multiple animations that run simultaneously.
*   **Staggered Animation:** Multiple animations that start with slight delays, creating a cascading effect.
*   **Animation Loop:** An animation that repeats continuously.
*   **Animation Orchestration:** Coordinating multiple animations to create complex animation behaviors.
