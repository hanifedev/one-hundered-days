# Day 91: Performance Optimization - React Performance Basics

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understanding Performance:** Learn why performance matters in mobile apps and what affects it (re-renders, large lists, heavy computations).
2.  **React.memo:** Learn how to use `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary component re-renders.
3.  **useMemo Hook:** Understand when and how to use `useMemo` to memoize expensive computations.
4.  **useCallback Hook:** Learn how to use `useCallback` to memoize functions and prevent unnecessary re-renders.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Optimize an existing component using React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Performance optimization is crucial for creating smooth, responsive apps. Unnecessary re-renders can cause lag and poor user experience. React provides tools like `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` to optimize performance by preventing unnecessary work.

Understanding when to use these optimization tools is important—over-optimization can make code harder to read, while under-optimization can cause performance issues. Learning to identify performance bottlenecks and apply the right optimizations is a key skill.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand React performance optimization basics. You'll be able to use React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-renders and computations. This knowledge enables you to build performant React Native applications.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Performance Optimization:** Techniques used to improve app speed, responsiveness, and efficiency.
*   **Re-render:** When a component updates and renders again, potentially causing performance issues if unnecessary.
*   **React.memo:** A higher-order component that prevents re-renders when props haven't changed.
*   **useMemo:** A hook that memoizes expensive computations, recalculating only when dependencies change.
*   **useCallback:** A hook that memoizes functions, preventing unnecessary re-renders of child components.
