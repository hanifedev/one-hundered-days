# Day 60: Custom Hooks - Advanced Patterns and Practice

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Custom Hooks for API Calls:** Create custom hooks that handle API requests with loading, error, and data states (e.g., `useApi`, `useFetch`).
2.  **Custom Hooks for Forms:** Build custom hooks for form management (e.g., `useForm`, `useInput`) that handle validation and state.
3.  **Composing Custom Hooks:** Learn how to compose multiple custom hooks together to build complex functionality.
4.  **Custom Hooks Best Practices:** Understand naming conventions, when to create custom hooks, and how to structure them.
5.  **Practice Project:** Build a complete feature using multiple custom hooks, demonstrating your ability to create reusable, well-structured code.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Advanced custom hooks can handle complex scenarios like API calls (managing loading, error, and success states) or form management (handling inputs, validation, submission). Composing hooks (using one hook inside another) allows you to build powerful, reusable abstractions.

Following best practices (like naming hooks with "use", keeping them focused on a single concern, documenting them well) makes your codebase more maintainable. Custom hooks are a key part of modern React development and are essential for building scalable applications.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to create advanced custom hooks for common patterns like API calls and form management. You'll understand how to compose hooks, follow best practices, and build reusable logic that makes your codebase cleaner and more maintainable. This knowledge is crucial for professional React Native development.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Hook Composition:** The practice of using one custom hook inside another to build more complex functionality.
*   **API Hook:** A custom hook that encapsulates the logic for making API calls, including loading, error, and data states.
*   **Form Hook:** A custom hook that manages form state, validation, and submission logic.
*   **Abstraction:** A way of hiding complex implementation details behind a simpler interface.
*   **Single Responsibility Principle:** A design principle stating that a function or hook should have one reason to change, focusing on a single concern.
