# Day 38: Navigation - Tab Navigator

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Introduction to Tab Navigator:** Understand when to use Tab Navigator (for apps with multiple main sections like Home, Profile, Settings).
2.  **Install Tab Navigator:** Install `@react-navigation/bottom-tabs` for bottom tab navigation.
3.  **Create Tab Navigator:** Set up a Tab Navigator with multiple tabs (e.g., Home, Search, Profile, Settings).
4.  **Tab Configuration:** Customize tab appearance with icons, labels, and styling using `tabBarOptions` or `screenOptions`.
5.  **Combine Navigators:** Learn how to nest a Stack Navigator inside a Tab Navigator (common pattern in real apps).

## 📖 Task Explanations

Tab Navigator provides a different navigation pattern—instead of stacking screens, it shows multiple tabs at the bottom (or top) of the screen, allowing users to quickly switch between main sections of your app. This is perfect for apps with distinct sections like social media apps (Home, Search, Notifications, Profile).

Many real-world apps combine Tab Navigator with Stack Navigator—each tab contains its own stack of screens. For example, the Home tab might have Home → Post Details → Comments, while the Profile tab has Profile → Edit Profile → Settings. Understanding this nesting pattern is essential for building professional applications.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to create tab-based navigation in your React Native applications. You'll understand when to use Tab Navigator versus Stack Navigator, how to customize tabs, and how to combine different navigators for complex navigation structures. This knowledge enables you to build apps with intuitive navigation patterns that users expect.
