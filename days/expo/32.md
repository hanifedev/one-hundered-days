# Day 32: User Input & Project - Button and Touchable Components

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Button Component:** Learn how to use the basic `Button` component and its limitations.
2.  **Touchable Components:** Explore `TouchableOpacity`, `TouchableHighlight`, and `Pressable`—the more flexible alternatives to `Button`.
3.  **Styling Touchable Components:** Learn how to style and customize touchable components to match your app's design.
4.  **Handling Press Events:** Understand how to handle `onPress` events and create interactive buttons.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Create a form with styled buttons using `TouchableOpacity` or `Pressable` for submit and cancel actions.

## 📖 Task Explanations

While React Native provides a basic `Button` component, it's quite limited in terms of styling. For most real-world applications, you'll use `TouchableOpacity`, `TouchableHighlight`, or `Pressable` to create custom-styled buttons. These components give you full control over appearance and behavior.

`Pressable` is the most modern and flexible option, providing fine-grained control over press states. `TouchableOpacity` is widely used for its simplicity and visual feedback. Understanding when to use each will help you build better user interfaces.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to create interactive buttons and touchable elements in your React Native applications. You'll understand the differences between various touchable components and know when to use each one. This knowledge is essential for building responsive and user-friendly interfaces.
