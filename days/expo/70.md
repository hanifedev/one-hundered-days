# Day 70: Unit Testing (Jest) - Testing Custom Hooks and Services

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Testing Custom Hooks:** Learn how to test custom hooks using `@testing-library/react-hooks` or React Testing Library.
2.  **Hook Testing Patterns:** Understand how to test hooks that use state, effects, and other hooks.
3.  **Testing Services:** Learn how to test service layer functions, including mocking API calls.
4.  **Async Testing:** Understand how to test asynchronous code (async functions, promises) in Jest.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Write comprehensive tests for your custom hooks and service functions, ensuring they work correctly in all scenarios.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Testing custom hooks requires special tools because hooks can only be called inside React components. Testing libraries provide utilities to render hooks in a test environment and verify their behavior. Testing services involves mocking API calls and verifying that the service functions work correctly.

Async testing is important because many functions in React Native are asynchronous (API calls, AsyncStorage, etc.). Jest provides utilities like `async/await` and `waitFor` to handle asynchronous code in tests.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to test custom hooks and service functions comprehensively. You'll understand how to test asynchronous code and use testing utilities for hooks. This knowledge ensures your reusable logic (hooks and services) is reliable and well-tested.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Hook Testing:** The practice of testing React hooks in isolation to verify their behavior.
*   **Service Testing:** Testing service layer functions to ensure they correctly interact with APIs and handle data.
*   **Async Testing:** Testing asynchronous code using async/await or Jest's async utilities.
*   **Test Utilities:** Helper functions and tools provided by testing libraries to make testing easier.
*   **Hook Renderer:** A utility that allows you to render and test hooks outside of React components.
