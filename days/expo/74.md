# Day 74: Component Testing - Async Component Testing

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Testing Async Operations:** Learn how to test components that perform async operations (API calls, data fetching).
2.  **Waiting for Updates:** Understand how to use `waitFor` and `findBy` queries to wait for async operations to complete.
3.  **Testing Loading States:** Verify that components show loading indicators while async operations are in progress.
4.  **Testing Error States:** Test that components handle and display errors correctly when async operations fail.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Write comprehensive tests for components that fetch data, handle loading states, and display errors.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Many components perform async operations like fetching data from APIs. Testing these components requires waiting for async operations to complete before making assertions. React Native Testing Library provides `waitFor` and `findBy` queries to handle async testing.

Testing loading and error states ensures your components provide good user feedback. These tests verify that users see appropriate messages during loading and when errors occur, which is crucial for a good user experience.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to test components that perform async operations. You'll understand how to wait for async code, test loading states, and verify error handling. This knowledge ensures your data-fetching components work correctly and provide good user feedback.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Async Component Testing:** Testing components that perform asynchronous operations (API calls, data fetching).
*   **`waitFor`:** A utility from Testing Library that waits for an assertion to pass, useful for async operations.
*   **`findBy` Queries:** Query methods that automatically wait for elements to appear (useful for async rendering).
*   **Loading State Testing:** Verifying that components display loading indicators during async operations.
*   **Error State Testing:** Verifying that components handle and display errors correctly when operations fail.
