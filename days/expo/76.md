# Day 76: Animations (I) - Introduction to React Native Animated API

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understanding Animations:** Learn why animations are important in mobile apps (improving UX, providing feedback, guiding attention).
2.  **Introduction to Animated API:** Understand what React Native's Animated API is and when to use it.
3.  **Animated Values:** Learn about `Animated.Value` and `Animated.ValueXY` for creating animated values.
4.  **Basic Animation:** Create your first simple animation (fade in, slide, scale) using `Animated.timing()`.
5.  **Practice Exercise:** Build a simple component with a basic animation (e.g., a button that scales on press, a card that fades in).

## 📖 Task Explanations

Animations make mobile apps feel polished and responsive. They provide visual feedback, guide user attention, and improve the overall user experience. React Native's Animated API is the built-in way to create animations, and it's powerful enough for most animation needs.

Animated values are the foundation of animations—they hold the current animated value (like opacity, position, scale) and can be animated over time. Understanding animated values and basic timing animations is the first step to creating smooth, professional animations.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand the basics of React Native's Animated API and be able to create simple animations. You'll know how to use animated values and timing animations to add motion to your components. This knowledge is the foundation for creating more complex animations.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Animation:** The illusion of motion created by rapidly changing visual properties over time.
*   **Animated API:** React Native's built-in API for creating animations.
*   **Animated Value:** A value that can be animated over time (e.g., opacity, position, scale).
*   **`Animated.timing()`:** A function that animates a value over a specified duration using an easing function.
*   **Easing Function:** A function that determines how an animation accelerates and decelerates.
