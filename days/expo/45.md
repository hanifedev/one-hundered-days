# Day 45: API Integration (I) - Practice Project

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Project Goal:** Build a complete application that integrates with a real API (e.g., a news reader, weather app, or movie database app).
2.  **API Selection:** Choose a public API (like NewsAPI, OpenWeatherMap, or The Movie Database) and explore its documentation.
3.  **Full CRUD Implementation:** Implement all CRUD operations if the API supports them, or at least GET and POST.
4.  **State Management:** Properly manage loading, error, and data states throughout your application.
5.  **Polish:** Add proper error messages, loading indicators, and ensure a smooth user experience even when the API is slow or fails.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today you'll consolidate all your API integration knowledge by building a complete application that interacts with a real API. This project will combine everything you've learned: making different types of HTTP requests, handling responses, managing loading and error states, and creating a polished user experience.

Choose an API that interests you—this will make the project more engaging. Pay attention to the API documentation, as real-world APIs often have specific requirements (authentication, rate limits, data formats). This experience will prepare you for working with production APIs in professional projects.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have built a complete React Native application that successfully integrates with a real API. You'll have practical experience with API documentation, error handling, loading states, and creating a polished user experience. This project demonstrates your ability to build data-driven applications and will be a valuable addition to your portfolio.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **API Documentation:** Written documentation that explains how to use an API, including endpoints, parameters, authentication, and response formats.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Restrictions on how many API requests can be made in a given time period.
*   **API Key:** A unique identifier used to authenticate API requests and track usage.
*   **Endpoint:** A specific URL that represents a resource or action in an API.
*   **Data-Driven Application:** An application that fetches and displays data from external sources (APIs) rather than using only local data.
